# Preconception Exercise and Male Fertility: What the Best Evidence Says

Scope and exclusions
- Population: Healthy adults (even if sedentary), during the preconception/trying-to-conceive (TTC) period.
- Exclude: Studies focused on unhealthy cohorts (e.g., obesity treatment, specific diseases), infertile-only clinic interventions, or exercise performed during pregnancy.
- Outcomes prioritized: Couple-level fecundability/time-to-pregnancy (TTP) and male semen parameters in healthy samples.
- Researcher mode: I include peer‑reviewed sources with links and note limitations. Humour mode: light sprinkles only—because your swimmers like pools, not hot tubs.

Dad-joke pit stop: Treat your testes like Wi‑Fi routers—keep them cool and don’t sit on them for hours binge-watching shows.

1) A prospective study of male physical activity and fecundability (PRESTO)
- Citation and link: Wesselink AK, Whitcomb BW, Wise LA, et al. (2025) Human Reproduction. A prospective study of male physical activity and fecundability (Wesselink 2025)[https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article/40/2/360/7925741]; PubMed (39680487)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39680487/]. << paywall
- Methodology: Prospective preconception cohort (PRESTO) of North American pregnancy planners; follow-up up to 12 cycles; discrete-time fecundability modeling. Male exposures assessed preconception and during TTC.
- Exercise description: Leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) by intensity (moderate/vigorous; e.g., running, gym classes, team sports, swimming). Bicycling was captured separately (hours/week, frequency).
- Duration and frequency: Habitual weekly hours; categorized for analyses.
- Main findings:
  - Total male LTPA showed little to no association with couple fecundability after adjustment.
  - Higher weekly bicycling was associated with reduced fecundability in some categories, suggesting a potential adverse dose-response at higher volumes.
- Positive vs negative effects:
  - Positive: No evidence that guideline-level MVPA harms fecundability; overall neutral.
  - Negative: Signals of lower fecundability with higher-volume cycling.
- Limitations: Self-reported activity; potential measurement error; observational (residual confounding—e.g., heat exposure from saunas/hot tubs, job heat); generalizable mainly to North American pregnancy planners.

2) Physical activity and television watching in relation to semen quality in healthy young men
- Citation and link: Gaskins AJ, et al. (2013) Br J Sports Med. Physical activity and television watching in relation to semen quality in young men (Gaskins 2013)[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3868632/]; PubMed[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23380634/].
- Methodology: Cross-sectional; 189 healthy college-aged men; semen analysis to WHO criteria; self-reported MVPA and television viewing.
- Exercise description: MVPA included running, weight training, recreational sports; sedentary behavior via TV watching.
- Duration and frequency: MVPA categories <5, 5–14, ≥15 h/week; TV <5, 5–19, ≥20 h/week.
- Main findings:
  - ≥15 h/week MVPA was associated with higher sperm concentration and total sperm count.
  - ≥20 h/week TV viewing associated with lower sperm concentration, independent of MVPA.
- Positive vs negative effects:
  - Positive: Higher MVPA linked to better semen indices.
  - Negative: High sedentary time (TV) linked to poorer semen indices.
- Limitations: Cross-sectional (cannot infer causality or TTP); convenience sample; self-report may misclassify exposures.

- Methodology: Narrative review synthesizing human evidence on PA, semen parameters, and mechanisms; includes healthy and athletic cohorts (and notes on clinical cohorts).
- Exercise description: Moderate PA (e.g., brisk walking, light cycling, lap swimming) and vigorous PA (e.g., running, fast cycling/spinning, competitive sports); discussion of mode-specific effects (notably cycling).
- Duration and frequency: Summarizes hour/week categories common across studies; notes dose-response for certain modes (cycling).
- Main findings (restricted here to healthy cohorts and preconception context):
  - Moderate PA is generally associated with neutral-to-beneficial semen parameters and hormonal balance.
  - Very high-volume endurance training and high-volume cycling show the most consistent signals of detriment (e.g., lower counts or motility), likely via heat and perineal pressure.
- Positive vs negative effects:
  - Positive: Moderate PA supports better overall reproductive profile in healthy men.
  - Negative: High-volume cycling/endurance may impair some parameters.
- Limitations: Heterogeneity in exposures/outcomes; many observational studies; some included clinical or infertile cohorts—interpretation here focuses on healthy-sample findings.

- Citation and link: Andersen et al. (2017) Fertility and Sterility. Associations between physical activity and semen quality in young men (Andersen 2017)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028216629667].
- Design: Cross-sectional study among healthy, young, non-fathers.
- Exercise description: Self-reported PA levels; general aerobic activities typical for young adults.
- Duration/frequency: Hours per week categories (as per study questionnaire).
- Findings: PA associated with differences in sperm motility profiles (e.g., altered immotile sperm percentage); no consistent major deficits at moderate levels.
- Methodology limitations: Cross-sectional; self-report; specific demographic (young, lean, educated) may limit generalizability.


3) Male personal heat exposures and fecundability (preconception)
- Citation and link: Mínguez-Alarcón L, et al. (2023) Andrology. Male personal heat exposures and fecundability (Mínguez‑Alarcón 2023)[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/andr.13242].
- Design: Prospective preconception cohort; male heat exposure index vs fecundability.
- Relevance to exercise: Supports mechanism where scrotal heat (e.g., prolonged cycling, hot environments) can reduce fecundability; complements cycling findings.
- Findings: Greater cumulative heat exposure associated with moderate reduction in fecundability, especially ≥30 years.
- Limitations: Exposure misclassification possible; observational.

4) Review: Impact of physical activity on semen quality
- Citation and link: Xu et al. (2024) Asian Journal of Andrology. Impact of physical activity on semen quality: a review (Xu 2024)[https://journals.lww.com/ajandrology/fulltext/9900/impact_of_physical_activity_on_semen_quality__a.294.aspx] (PDF alt)[https://journals.lww.com/ajandrology/_layouts/15/oaks.journals/downloadpdf.aspx?an=00129336-990000000-00294].
- Design: Narrative review focusing on PA’s influence on semen quality, reclassifying by fertility status.
- Findings (healthy cohorts): Moderate PA beneficial/neutral; endurance extremes and heavy cycling show potential detriments; emphasizes mechanisms (hormonal, oxidative balance).
- Limitations: Not a meta-analysis; includes mixed populations—interpretation here limited to healthy adults.

5) Meta-analysis: Effects of physical activity on fertility parameters
- Citation and link: Abedpoor N, et al. (2024) World Journal of Men’s Health. Effects of Physical Activity on Fertility Parameters (Abedpoor 2024)[https://wjmh.org/pdf/10.5534/wjmh.230106].
- Design: Quantitative synthesis/meta-analysis of PA and male fertility parameters.
- Findings (broadly): PA associated with improvements in certain semen parameters; heterogeneity by modality/intensity with caution for high-volume endurance/cycling.
- Limitations: Aggregates heterogeneous designs; some included studies involve non-healthy samples—apply findings specifically to healthy cohorts with caution.

6) Narrative synthesis on exercise intensity and male fertility
- Citation and link: Abedpoor N, et al. (2024) Frontiers in Reproductive Health. Exploring the dynamics of exercise intensity on male reproductive health (Abedpoor 2024b)[https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/reproductive-health/articles/10.3389/frph.2024.1423916/full].
- Design: Literature review emphasizing intensity gradients.
- Findings: Moderate-intensity training generally favorable; high-intensity/high-volume endurance may impair motility/count via heat, oxidative stress, and energy availability pathways.
- Limitations: Narrative, not meta-analytic; includes non-healthy and athletic extremes—applied here to healthy adults cautiously.

Note on excluded evidence: Randomized trials in infertile men (e.g., exercise interventions improving semen parameters) exist but are excluded here to align with the healthy-cohort scope.

------------------------------------------------------------

Practical guidance for healthy men TTC (based on the above)
- Do regular, moderate-to-vigorous activity: Aim for 150–300 min/week moderate OR 75–150 min/week vigorous, plus 2 days/week of resistance work. This is neutral-to-beneficial for fertility and overall health.
- Break up long sitting: High TV time is repeatedly linked to poorer semen quality—stand, walk, or do brief mobility every 30–60 minutes.
- Go easy on high-volume cycling while TTC: If you clock many saddle hours, moderate volume, optimize fit/saddle, use padded shorts, and cross-train (running, rowing, swimming).
- Mind the heat: Avoid hot tubs/saunas and prolonged heat exposure (including on-bike perineal pressure and tight, insulating gear). Keep the boys cool.
- Support recovery: Sleep, adequate energy and protein, and avoid extreme, sudden jumps in endurance load.
