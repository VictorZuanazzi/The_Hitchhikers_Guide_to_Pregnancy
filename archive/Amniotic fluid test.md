# Amniotic fluid test

Here’s the fast take, with receipts.

What’s being measured?

“Total volume” (true AFV) = actual milliliters of fluid, best measured by invasive dye‑dilution or by directly collecting fluid at cesarean; these are the reference standards. 

Deepest/Maximum Vertical Pocket (DVP/MVP/SDP) = the single deepest cord‑free pocket in cm on ultrasound; AFI = sum of the deepest pockets in 4 quadrants (cm). Neither ultrasound method converts reliably to true milliliters. 


How do DVP/AFI relate to true total volume?

Ultrasound estimates (AFI or DVP) correlate only modestly with dye‑determined volumes and poorly identify real abnormal volumes (both oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios). No dependable “cm → mL” conversion. 


Which metric is more useful for problems?

Oligohydramnios (too little fluid):

RCTs + meta‑analyses: using AFI detects “oligo” more often and drives more inductions/C‑sections without improving perinatal outcomes; DVP reduces interventions with similar outcomes → preferred. 

Summaries/guidelines echo this (choose DVP for low fluid in singleton pregnancies). 


Polyhydramnios (too much fluid):

SMFM allows either definition (DVP ≥ 8 cm or AFI ≥ 24 cm). 

Some data suggest AFI may tag higher‑risk polyhydramnios cohorts than DVP (worse outcomes when poly is defined by AFI alone), so AFI can be more sensitive for “high fluid” risk stratification. 

Practical nuance from reviews: use DVP to screen; if DVP ≥ 8 cm, add AFI to grade severity. 


Bottom line (what to use, when)

Suspected low fluid / routine surveillance → DVP (≤ 2 cm = oligohydramnios): fewer false positives and fewer unnecessary deliveries, with similar baby outcomes. 

Suspected high fluid → either works, but AFI may better flag riskier cases; confirm and manage per SMFM thresholds (AFI ≥ 24 cm or DVP ≥ 8 cm). 

Remember: both ultrasound methods are imperfect surrogates of true mL, so interpret in clinical context (growth, Dopplers, BPP/NST, symptoms). 


If amniotic fluid were beer, AFI is “sum of four glasses,” DVP is “biggest pint,” and dye‑dilution is actually pouring and measuring—sadly, only the last tells you how much is really in the keg. 🍺
