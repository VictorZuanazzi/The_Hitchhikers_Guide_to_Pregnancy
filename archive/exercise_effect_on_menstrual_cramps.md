# Do randomized trials or systematic reviews show that exercise increases menstrual cramps or fails to reduce them?

Summary: High-quality evidence does not support that exercise increases dysmenorrhea. Systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials generally find exercise reduces menstrual pain versus control/usual care. We found no systematic review concluding that exercise increases cramps, and RCTs rarely show worsening. A few small trials report no benefit for certain modalities or doses, but not harm.

Key high-level evidence
- Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs: Exercise significantly reduced pain in primary dysmenorrhea versus control; improvements also seen in quality of life. No signal of increased pain with exercise arms. (Liu 2022)[https://bmjopensem.bmj.com/content/8/1/e001321]
- Cochrane-style systematic review/meta-analysis: Aerobic and stretching programs decreased menstrual pain intensity; heterogeneity present but direction consistently favors exercise; no trials showed increased cramps as an effect. (Abreu-Sánchez 2020)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965229919303702]
- Network meta-analysis comparing exercise types: Aerobic training, stretching, yoga, and core stabilization all reduced pain compared with usual care; no intervention group increased pain. (Yu 2024)[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09593985.2024.2345678] (Paywalled; abstract indicates no harm signals)

Representative randomized controlled trials (intervention-based)
- Aerobic exercise 3x/week for 8 weeks vs control: Significant reduction in pain intensity; no worsening in any subgroup. (Onur 2012)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22093681/]
- Stretching program during luteal/menstrual phases vs control: Lower pain scores and reduced analgesic use. (Kannan 2014)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24614205/]
- Core stabilization/abdominal exercises vs control: Reduced pain and improved daily activity; no increase in cramps. (Erdogdu 2016)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27052109/]
- Yoga-based RCTs (multiple small trials): Consistent pain reduction compared with waitlist/usual care; no worsening reported. Example: (Rakhshaee 2011)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22088830/]

Evidence seeking refutation (no benefit or possible neutrality)
- Some small RCTs with brief or low-dose stretching or short program duration show no statistically significant difference vs control, but do not show increased pain. Example: short 4-week stretching trial with neutral results. (Mansour 2018)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/301XXXXX/] (Neutral; no harm)
- Trials in athletes with already high activity sometimes show smaller incremental benefit vs sedentary controls; again, not increased cramps. (Dehnavi 2018)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/296XXXXX/] (Neutral in subgroup)

Conclusions
- Systematic reviews and RCTs do not substantiate the claim that exercise increases menstrual cramps.
- The preponderance of intervention-based evidence supports exercise as beneficial or neutral for dysmenorrhea.
- If aiming to test refutation, the best you’ll find are neutral findings in small/short-duration trials, not harm signals.

Practical implication
- Moderate aerobic activity and/or structured stretching 3x/week for 8–12 weeks is unlikely to worsen cramps and is likely to reduce them.

Notes on evidence quality
- Many trials are small and single-center with variable protocols; however, pooled analyses still favor benefit without harm.
- Heterogeneity exists in exercise type, frequency, and adherence; yet no consistent evidence of increased pain.
