# Preconception Physical Activity and Fertility in Women

**work in progress**

> **The Gist**


For women trying to conceive, being regularly active before pregnancy is neutral-to-beneficial for your chances of conceiving per cycle. Prospective preconception cohorts that followed women from “we’re trying” until pregnancy found that moderate-to-vigorous leisure-time activity was linked to slightly higher fecundability (time-to-pregnancy), with no harm at typical, sustainable volumes.

- Outcomes: Fecundability (time-to-pregnancy), conception rates, and for men, semen quality or fecundability; couple-level fecundability where available.

Key gist (what the strongest evidence suggests)
- Women: Habitual moderate-to-vigorous activity before conception is neutral-to-beneficial for fecundability; sudden extreme volumes without adequate fueling/rest can impair cycles.
- Men: More overall moderate-to-vigorous activity and less sedentary time associated with better semen quality; high-volume cycling may be detrimental.
- Couples: Prospective preconception cohorts show modestly favorable or neutral associations of women’s activity with fecundability; male overall activity appears largely neutral for fecundability, with a negative signal for high-volume bicycling.

Note on “exercise” definitions used in these studies
- Moderate: brisk walking, casual cycling, doubles tennis, easy lap swimming, light aerobics.
- Vigorous: running/jogging, fast cycling/spin classes, high-intensity aerobics/intervals, lap swimming at higher intensity, competitive sports.
- Most studies used leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) self-report in hours/week within categories.

Practical takeaways for couples trying to conceive
- Aim for regular PA most days: about 150–300 min/week moderate, or 75–150 min/week vigorous, or a mix (plus 2 days/week of muscle-strengthening), built up gradually.
- Women: Moderate-to-vigorous LTPA appears neutral-to-beneficial for time-to-pregnancy when well-fueled; avoid sudden leaps to extreme volumes if you have a history of cycle sensitivity.
- Men: Keep up general MVPA and break up sedentary time; consider limiting high-volume weekly cycling (e.g., many hours over multiple days/week) while trying to conceive.
- Both: Favor sustainable routines you can maintain through the conception window; ensure adequate nutrition and sleep to support training.


### Physical activity and fertility 

- Design: Narrative/systematic review summarizing observational evidence on PA/sedentary behavior and spontaneous fertility in healthy men and women.
- Exercise description: Summarizes moderate and vigorous LTPA, sedentary time, cycling.
- Duration & frequency: Synthesizes across studies, typically hours/week categories.
- Main findings: Moderate-to-vigorous preconception PA appears neutral-to-beneficial for female fecundability; high-volume cycling in men may impair semen parameters; sedentary time inversely associated with semen quality; evidence largely observational.
- Methods/limits: Review-level synthesis; heterogeneity across studies; not limited to RCTs due to scarcity preconception.
- Positive effects: Supports moderate-to-vigorous PA for women; higher MVPA and less sedentary time for men.
- Negative effects: High-volume cycling may be detrimental.

### A prospective cohort study of physical activity and time-to-pregnancy

Wise et al. 2012 (Snart-Gravid, Denmark) 

- Population & design: Prospective preconception cohort of 3628 healthy women attempting natural conception, followed up to 12 cycles (time-to-pregnancy modeling) in the Snart-Gravid internet-based cohort (Denmark).
- Exercise description:
  - Self-reported leisure-time PA by intensity (moderate vs vigorous) and hours/week.
  - Examples explicitly included walking, cycling, running/jogging, aerobics/fitness classes.
- Duration & frequency: Habitual hours per week, reported in categories across moderate and vigorous intensities at baseline (preconception).
- Main findings:
  - Moderate PA was associated with a small increase in fecundability overall.
  - Vigorous PA showed heterogeneity by body composition in sensitivity analyses; in lean women, high volumes of vigorous activity could be associated with reduced fecundability, whereas no harm was evident at moderate volumes.
- Methodology: Prospective cohort; discrete-time proportional probabilities models for fecundability; extensive covariate adjustment (age, BMI, smoking, alcohol/caffeine, intercourse frequency, menstrual regularity, parity, education).
- Limitations:
  - Self-reported PA; misclassification likely biases toward the null.
  - Observational design cannot prove causation; residual confounding possible.
  - Internet-based recruitment may introduce selection bias.
- Positive effects: Moderate PA associated with improved fecundability; no evidence of harm at moderate levels in healthy-weight women.
- Negative effects: Very high vigorous volumes in lean women may be counterproductive (likely via energy deficiency/menstrual disturbance).

### Body mass index, physical activity, and fecundability in a North American preconception cohort

- Population & design: Prospective preconception cohort (PRESTO) of healthy pregnancy planners in the US/Canada; time-to-pregnancy followed up to 12 cycles.
- Exercise description:
  - Women’s self-reported LTPA categorized by intensity and hours/week; typical examples: walking, cycling, running, aerobics/fitness.
- Duration & frequency: Habitual weekly categories for moderate and vigorous PA at baseline preconception.
- Main findings:
  - Moderate PA was associated with improved fecundability overall after adjustment.
  - Associations for vigorous PA varied by BMI in stratified analyses; among healthy-weight women, neutral to modestly positive associations were observed without evidence of harm at typical volumes.
- Methodology: Prospective cohort; discrete-time models; robust covariate adjustment (age, BMI, smoking, alcohol/caffeine, intercourse frequency, menstrual characteristics, parity, education).
- Limitations:
  - Self-reported PA; measurement error.
  - Observational; possible residual confounding.
  - Some subgroup findings may be underpowered.
- Positive effects: Moderate preconception PA beneficial/neutral for time-to-pregnancy in healthy-weight women; no harm with typical vigorous volumes.
- Negative effects: Very high vigorous volumes may not add benefit and could be counterproductive in energy-deficient contexts.

## Additional supporting evidence 

### A prospective study of male physical activity and fecundability

Full text not publicly available.

Wesselink/Whitcomb/Wise et al. 2025 (PRESTO) — 

- Population & design: Prospective North American preconception cohort (PRESTO) of couples trying to conceive; male partners reported PA prior to and during attempts; couples followed for up to 12 cycles.
- Exercise description:
  - Male self-reported weekly hours of moderate and vigorous LTPA, and specific sport modes including bicycling.
  - Examples: running, gym-based exercise/fitness classes, swimming, team sports; cycling captured separately by hours/week.
- Duration & frequency: Habitual hours/week in categories for moderate/vigorous PA; bicycling queried as hours/week and frequency.
- Main findings:
  - Overall male LTPA showed little to no association with fecundability after adjustment.
  - Higher weekly bicycling was associated with reduced fecundability in some categories, suggesting a potential adverse dose-response for high-volume cycling.
- Methodology: Prospective cohort; discrete-time fecundability models; adjustment for male and female covariates (ages, BMI, smoking, alcohol, intercourse frequency, prior fertility, etc.).
- Limitations:
  - Self-reported PA and bicycling exposure; possible misclassification.
  - Observational; residual confounding by lifestyle factors (e.g., heat exposure, hot tubs) cannot be excluded.
  - Generalizability primarily to North American pregnancy planners.
- Positive effects: No evidence that general moderate/vigorous PA harms male fecundability.
- Negative effects: High-volume bicycling may lower fecundability; consider moderating saddle time.

### Physical activity and television watching in relation to semen quality in young men

Reviewed!

Gaskins et al. 2013 — 
- Design: Cross-sectional study of 189 healthy college-aged men with semen analysis per WHO criteria.
- Exercise description: Self-reported weekly hours of moderate-to-vigorous PA (running, weight training, recreational sports); sedentary behavior via TV watching hours/week.
- Duration & frequency: MVPA categories such as <5, 5–14, ≥15 h/week; TV watching <5, 5–19, ≥20 h/week.
