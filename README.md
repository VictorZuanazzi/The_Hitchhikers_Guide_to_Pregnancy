# The Pregnant Dad

Pregnancy is challenging enough for mothers, but as a supporting partner, understanding how to help can make a significant difference. This project collects research-based information to guide expecting fathers — and mothers — through pregnancy.

Main lesson so far: Mostly of the recommendations for an healthy lifestyle are also true for a healthy pregnancy. Don't freak out, most decisions are not on matters of life and death. Alchool is generally bad for you, but in moderation it has limited negative effects, similarly during the pregnancy. Exercises lead to healthier mother - pregnant or not!.
