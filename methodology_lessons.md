## Lessons

Using LLMs as research assistants can be as convenient as it can be misleading! That is what I learned of the best way to use LLMs:

1. Aways request links to the sources and review them. Often LLMs will allucinate sources or link completely unrelated studies. A high-level review will make this evident pretty quickly.
2. Read the evidence. LLMs make it easier to find the relevant studies, but they don't have cognitive capabilities, LLMs can't reason.
3. Ask specific questions. Instead of asking "evidence in about alcohol consumption," ask "what is the evidence supporting low levels of alcohol consumption" and "what is the evidnce against low levels of alcohol consumption." The results tend to be widely different.
