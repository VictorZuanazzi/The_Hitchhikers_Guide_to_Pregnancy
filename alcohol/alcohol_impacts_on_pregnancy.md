# Scientific Evidence on Low Alcohol Consumption During Pregnancy

**WIP**

## Evidence against low alcohol consumption

### 1. University of Sydney Study (2020)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Less than 35g per week (approximately 2-3 standard drinks)
* **Sample Size**: 9,719 children and their mothers
* **Key Correlations**: Controlled for maternal age, socioeconomic status, education level, smoking, and mental health status
* **Findings**: Even low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were associated with psychological and behavioral problems in children, including increased anxiety, depression, and attention difficulties

This study is considered particularly robust due to its large sample size and comprehensive controls for potential confounding variables. The researchers concluded that "even small amounts of alcohol consumed while pregnant can have a significant impact on a child's brain development," contradicting claims that occasional light drinking is harmless.

### 2. Mamluk et al. Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (2017)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Up to 32g per week (2 to 3 standard drinks)
* **Sample Size**: Meta-analysis encompassing 24 studies with tens of thousands of participants
* **Key Correlations**: Carefully assessed studies that controlled for socioeconomic status, maternal smoking, maternal age, and ethnicity
* **Findings**: No evidence of a "safe" threshold for alcohol consumption during pregnancy; increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight even with light drinking

Published in BMJ Open, this comprehensive review examined decades of research and concluded that guidelines recommending supposedly "safe" levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy should be reconsidered. The researchers emphasized that "the absence of evidence of harm should not be interpreted as evidence of absence of harm."

### 5. Easey et al. Systematic Review (2019)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Less than 21 units per week
* **Sample Size**: 33 studies examining mental health outcomes
* **Key Finding**: Evidence of association between prenatal alcohol exposure at low-to-moderate levels and poor mental health outcomes in offspring

### Critical Analysis of the Evidence

#### Strengths of Current Research

* **Large-scale studies**: Many studies now include thousands of participants, providing greater statistical power
* **Longitudinal designs**: Following children over many years allows assessment of long-term impacts
* **Advanced controls**: Modern studies better control for confounding factors like socioeconomic status

#### Limitations and Ongoing Challenges

* **Self-reporting bias**: Most studies rely on maternal self-reporting of alcohol consumption
* **Dose-response relationships**: Difficulty establishing precise dose-response relationships at low levels
* **Timing of exposure**: Challenges in determining if certain developmental periods are more vulnerable
* **Individual variations**: Genetic and environmental factors may influence individual susceptibility

### Why Abstinence Is Recommended

Medical and public health organizations worldwide recommend complete abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy because:

1. No study has identified a "safe" threshold for alcohol consumption during pregnancy;
2. Individual genetic variations in alcohol metabolism create unpredictable risk;
3. The potential harm, even if small for any individual, creates a significant burden on public health;
4. The risk-benefit calculation strongly favors abstinence as alcohol has no known benefits for fetal development;

## Evidence supporting low alcohol consumption

While official medical guidelines in many countries advocate complete abstinence during pregnancy, some scientific evidence suggests that very low levels of alcohol consumption may not be harmful. This document examines the most rigorous studies that found no significant negative outcomes associated with light drinking during pregnancy.

### Top 3 Most Rigorous Studies 

#### 1. The Danish National Birth Cohort Study (2012)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 1-4 drinks per week
* **Sample Size**: 1,628 women and their children from a larger cohort of 101,042 pregnant women
* **Key Correlations**: Controlled for maternal education, IQ, prenatal care access, smoking status, and pre-pregnancy BMI
* **Findings**: No significant differences in intelligence, attention, or executive function at age 5 between children of abstainers and those who consumed 1-4 drinks per week during pregnancy
* **Methodology Strengths**: Prospective design, multiple assessment tools, detailed maternal interviews, standardized outcome measures

[[2]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4435537/)

The researchers concluded: "Low to moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy was not associated with executive function deficits at age 5 years." The study is particularly valuable because it employed multiple validated assessment tools and controlled for numerous potential confounding factors.

#### 2. UK Millennium Cohort Study (Kelly et al., 2012)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 1-2 units per week or per occasion (1 unit = 8g of alcohol)
* **Sample Size**: 11,513 children and mothers followed from birth
* **Key Correlations**: Controlled for maternal age, education, income, smoking, mental health, and parenting style
* **Findings**: Children of light drinkers showed no increased risk of cognitive or behavioral problems compared to children of abstainers; in some measures, they performed slightly better
* **Limitations**: Potential socioeconomic confounding - light drinkers were more likely to come from higher-income, higher-education households

[[3]](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.12246)

The researchers noted: "At age 7 years, children born to light drinkers had no increased risk of clinically relevant behavioural difficulties or cognitive deficits compared with children of abstinent mothers." This large-scale, longitudinal study provided robust evidence that occasional, light drinking did not appear to impact developmental outcomes at age 7.

#### 3. Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (2023)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Less than 7 standard drinks per week, never more than 2 on any occasion
* **Sample Size**: 3,723 women and their children
* **Key Correlations**: Carefully controlled for maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, mental health status, and smoking
* **Findings**: No significant differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes, academic performance, or behavioral issues between children of light drinkers and abstainers when assessed at ages 2, 5, and 8 years
* **Methodological Strengths**: Long follow-up period, multiple assessment points, comprehensive outcome measures

[[5]](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/7/e015410)

The researchers emphasized: "After controlling for socioeconomic status and other potentially confounding factors, we found no evidence that light maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy adversely affected child outcomes at age 8 years." The study is particularly valuable because it assessed outcomes at multiple time points throughout childhood.

### Additional Supporting Studies

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Occasional drinking (less than 1 drink per week)
* **Sample Size**: 2,900 pregnant women and their children
* **Key Finding**: No significant differences in child behavior, academic achievement, or cognitive function between children of light drinkers and abstainers at age 14

#### 5. Robinson et al. (2010)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Less than 10g of alcohol per week (approximately 1 standard drink)
* **Sample Size**: 2,370 mothers and children
* **Key Finding**: No significant effects on child behavior or development at age 2 and 5 years

#### 6. ALSPAC Study (2013)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 1-2 units per week (8-16g of alcohol)
* **Sample Size**: 7,857 mothers and children
* **Key Finding**: No adverse effects on childhood IQ at age 8 for children of light drinkers

[[10]](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3807618/) [[11]](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049407)

#### 7. Janni et al. (2022)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 1-3 drinks per week, never more than 1 per day
* **Sample Size**: 1,414 mother-child pairs
* **Key Finding**: No significant associations between light prenatal alcohol exposure and child academic performance at ages 6-10

## Critical Analysis of the Evidence

### Limitations of Existing Research

* **Self-Reporting Bias**: Most studies rely on maternal self-reporting of alcohol consumption, which may be unreliable
* **Socioeconomic Confounding**: Women who drink lightly during pregnancy often have higher education and income levels, which independently benefit child development
* **Genetic Variations**: Individual genetic differences in alcohol metabolism may influence fetal vulnerability to alcohol
* **Timing Sensitivity**: Certain developmental periods may be more vulnerable to alcohol exposure than others

### Why Abstinence Remains the Official Recommendation

Despite some evidence suggesting light drinking may not cause measurable harm, medical organizations still recommend abstinence because:

1. No study has definitively established a "safe" threshold of alcohol consumption;
2. Individual differences in maternal and fetal alcohol metabolism create unpredictable risks;
3. The potential for harm, even if small, outweighs any possible benefits of alcohol consumption;
4. Clear, consistent public health messaging is important for preventing heavier consumption;

## Conclusion

While several well-designed studies suggest that very light alcohol consumption during pregnancy (generally defined as 1-2 drinks per week) may not cause measurable harm to child development, the evidence is not conclusive enough to change public health recommendations. The safest approach remains abstinence, but the research does suggest that women who consumed small amounts of alcohol before learning they were pregnant likely have minimal cause for concern.

It's worth noting that Emily Oster's analysis in "Expecting Better" aligns with many of these research findings, though her conclusion that "there is no strong evidence against a drink a day" goes beyond what most of these studies support. The evidence more strongly supports occasional light drinking (1-2 drinks per week) rather than daily consumption.
