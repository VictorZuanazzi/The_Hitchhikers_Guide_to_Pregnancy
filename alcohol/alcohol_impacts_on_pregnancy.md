# Scientific Evidence on Low Alcohol Consumption During Pregnancy


> **The Gist**: There is evidence supporting low alcohol consumption (1 or 2 drinks a week) after the end of the first trimester cary no risk of harm to the baby or to the pregnancy. However, abstinence is still the safest approach. No need to rule out that 0.5% beer, or lose sleep over an accidental alcoholic bombom. Even a glass of champagne on a special occasion grants no reason for concern. Drinking often and heavy drinking (more than 2 drinks in any given occasion) must definitely be avoided as that implicates into serious consequences.

While official medical guidelines in many countries advocate complete abstinence during pregnancy, some scientific evidence suggests that very low levels of alcohol consumption may not be harmful. This document examines the most rigorous studies that found no significant negative outcomes associated with light drinking during pregnancy.

## The Game Plan: Why Abstinence Is the Safest Play

Medical experts agree: **the safest move during pregnancy is no alcohol at all.** While some studies hint that light drinking (1-2 drinks a week) might not harm the baby, there’s no confirmed “safe limit.” With risks like developmental issues and unknown factors (like unique genetics), skipping alcohol is the best strategy.

Some studies, like the **Danish Study** and **UK Millennium Cohort**, found no harm from occasional drinking. However, arguments exist to stick to zero:

- There’s no way to predict how alcohol might affect your baby.
- A clear-cut recommendation avoids confusion—no goalposts shifting here.
- It’s a team effort: if your partner’s cutting alcohol, join her in solidarity. Swap beers for mocktails.
- From a public health perspective, any percentage increase of risk pregnancies or risk births may put an unnecessary burder on the (usually already underfunded) health system. 

## Most relevant (and reviewed) studies

### 1. University of Sydney Study (2020)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Less than 7 drinks per week;
* **Sample Size**: 9,719 children and their mothers
* **Key Correlations**: Controlled for maternal age, socioeconomic status, education level, smoking, and mental health status
* **Findings**: Even low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy were associated with psychological and behavioral problems in children, including increased anxiety, depression, and attention difficulties

 The researchers concluded that "our findings suggest that youths exposed to even light alcohol doses in utero exhibit widespread differences in brain structure, when compared with unexposed youths". Even though the study has a large sample size and comprehensive controls for potential confounding variables, it is a restropective study that asked parents about their drink habits during pregnancy year after the child was born. Furthermore, their limit of 7 drinks is arguably on the high end of the "low consumption" spectrum. The researcher's findings agree with the scientific consensus, but they don't really answer if low and occasional alcohol consumption is problematic.

### 2. Mamluk et al. Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (2017)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Up to 32g per week, no more than 2 drinks at the time 
* **Sample Size**: Meta-analysis encompassing 24 studies with tens of thousands of participants
* **Key Correlations**: Carefully assessed studies that controlled for socioeconomic status, maternal smoking, maternal age, and ethnicity
* **Findings**: Found limited evidence on the causual connection between light drinking and complications to the pregnancy or to the baby's health. 

This comprehensive review examined decades of research specifically on low drinking levels (1 bottle of wine a month) and found little evidence on impacts to baby. The authos do caution the reader finishing the article with "However, describing the paucity of current research and explaining that ‘absence of evidence is not evidence of absence’, appears warranted." In English: _complications may exist even if we didn't find them_.

#### 3. The Danish National Birth Cohort Study (2012)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 1-4 drinks per week
* **Sample Size**: 1,628 women and their children from a larger cohort of 101,042 pregnant women
* **Key Correlations**: Controlled for maternal education, IQ, prenatal care access, smoking status, and pre-pregnancy BMI
* **Findings**: No significant differences in intelligence, attention, or executive function at age 5 between children of abstainers and those who consumed 1-4 drinks per week during pregnancy
* **Methodology Strengths**: Prospective design, multiple assessment tools, detailed maternal interviews, standardized outcome measures

The researchers concluded: "Low to moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy was not associated with executive function deficits at age 5 years." The study is particularly valuable because it employed multiple validated assessment tools and controlled for numerous potential confounding factors.

Worth noting that this is one of the main studies that Emily Oster uses to base her conclusions in her book _Expecting Better_, and NOPAFS put forward some limitations of the research.

#### 4. UK Millennium Cohort Study (Kelly et al., 2013)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 1-2 units per week or per occasion (1 unit = 8g of alcohol)
* **Sample Size**: 10,534 children and mothers followed from birth.
* **Key Correlations**: Controlled for maternal age, education, income, smoking, mental health, and parenting style
* **Findings**: Children of light drinkers showed no increased risk of cognitive or behavioral problems compared to children of abstainers; in some measures, they performed slightly better
* **Limitations**: This is a retrospective study where others were asked to recall their drinking patterns at 9 months of pregnancy. Recalling biases, shame, and other factors may affect the input given by the mothers.

The researchers noted: "At age 7 years, children born to light drinkers had no increased risk of clinically relevant behavioural difficulties or cognitive deficits compared with children of abstinent mothers." This large-scale, longitudinal study provided robust evidence that occasional, light drinking did not appear to impact developmental outcomes at age 7.

## Conclusion

While several well-designed studies suggest that very light alcohol consumption during pregnancy (generally defined as 1-2 drinks per week) may not cause measurable harm to child development, the evidence is not conclusive enough to change public health recommendations. The safest approach remains abstinence, despite the evidence supporting that women who consumed small amounts of alcohol before learning they were pregnant likely have minimal cause for concern.

It's worth noting that Emily Oster's analysis in "Expecting Better" aligns with many of these research findings, though her conclusion that "there is no strong evidence against a drink a day" goes beyond what most of these studies support. The evidence more strongly supports occasional light drinking (1-2 drinks per week) rather than daily consumption.

Given the potential negative consequences (such as a dumb child!), a conservative approach to near abstinence is granted. However, there is no reason to lose sleep over the occasional glass of wine (preferably after the 1st trimester) or an accidental alcoholic bombom. Pregnancy can be quite stressful already, no need to make it harder than it has to be.
