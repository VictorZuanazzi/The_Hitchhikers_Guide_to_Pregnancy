# Scientific Evidence on Health Risks of Low Alcohol Consumption in Adults

> **The Gist**: There is no level of drinking that is beneficial for your long-term health. The less you drink the better! And when you do drink, take it slow, don't rush to the bottom of that whisky bottle in a weekend, savor it through the month.

Scientific studies consistently show that **no** level of alcohol consumption is risk-free. While some research points to minor cardiovascular benefits from occasional drinking, the risks — including cancer, liver disease, and premature death - far outweigh any potential gains. Health organizations worldwide, like the WHO, Canada's, US, UK, Australia and France updated their guidelines, to urge significant caution. Australia has the losest guidelines of them recommending no more than 10 drinks a week and no more than 4 a day, France recommends at least 2 alcohol-free days and Canada is the strikest recommending no more than 2 drinks a week. Cheers to that!

_Do chicks get drunk faster?_ On average, yes, but they also face higher health risks. Women's blood alcohol levels are higher than men's for the same alcohol intake due to physiological factors like, body water content, metabolism, and hormones. Though the variations between individuals often outweight the gender distinctions. Most countries regonize that and adopt gender-neutral recommendations. Yet, on health, women face heightened risks, such as an increased likelihood of breast cancer and faster development of liver disease even at low levels of drinking. 

## The most important studies

### 1. Global Burden of Disease 2016 Alcohol Study (GBD 2016 Alcohol Collaborators, 2018)

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Any level of alcohol consumption, with specific analysis of low consumption (≤25 g/day or about 2 standard drinks)
* **Sample Size**: Data from 195 countries and territories, analyzing 694 data sources and 592 prospective and retrospective studies
* **Key Correlations**: Controlled for age, sex, year, and location; analyzed associations with 23 health outcomes including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and injuries
* **Findings**: The study concluded that the safest level of alcohol consumption is zero. The health risks associated with alcohol rise with increasing levels of consumption, and the level of consumption that minimizes health loss is zero.

This landmark study is considered particularly significant due to its global scope and comprehensive methodology. The researchers emphasized that "the widely held view of the health benefits of alcohol needs revising," noting that previous claims about benefits of moderate drinking were methodologically flawed. Their analysis found that alcohol was responsible for nearly 2.8 million deaths in 2016 and was the leading risk factor for premature death and disability among people aged 15-49 years old worldwide, accounting for nearly 10% of the deaths.

### 2. Wood et al. (2018) - Risk Thresholds for Alcohol Consumption

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Categorized as <100 g/week (approximately 5-6 standard drinks per week)
* **Sample Size**: Individual participant data from 599,912 current drinkers in 83 prospective studies
* **Key Correlations**: Controlled for age, smoking, history of diabetes, and other confounding factors; examined correlations with cardiovascular disease subtypes and total mortality
* **Findings**: Found a positive and curvilinear association between alcohol consumption and risk of all-cause mortality, with lowest risk at consumption levels of ≤100 g/week. Higher alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of stroke, fatal hypertensive disease, heart failure, and fatal aortic aneurysm.

This meticulously designed meta-analysis of individual participant data is particularly valuable because it aggregated data from a large number of prospective studies, allowing for detailed dose-response analyses. The researchers found that exceeding 100g of alcohol per week (roughly 5-6 standard drinks) was associated with lower life expectancy. For a 40-year-old, each additional 50g of alcohol consumed per week was associated with approximately 6 months shorter life expectancy.

Particularly significant was the finding that alcohol consumption showed different relationships with different cardiovascular disease subtypes. While some minor protective association was observed for myocardial infarction, alcohol consumption was associated with increased risk of stroke, heart failure, fatal hypertensive disease, and fatal aortic aneurysm. This challenges the simplified notion that alcohol is "good for the heart" and suggests a much more complex relationship between alcohol and cardiovascular health.

### 3. Stockwell et al. (2024) - Why Do Only Some Cohort Studies Find Health Benefits From Low-Volume Alcohol Consumption?

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Less than 25g of ethanol per day (approximately 1-2 standard drinks)
* **Sample Size**: Meta-analysis of multiple cohort studies involving several million participants
* **Key Correlations**: Analyzed study characteristics including inclusion of former drinkers in abstainer groups, adequate control for confounding factors, and quality of alcohol consumption measurement
* **Findings**: Studies that properly excluded former drinkers from abstainer groups and adequately controlled for confounding factors showed no significant mortality benefit from low-volume alcohol consumption.

This recent meta-analysis specifically addressed methodological issues in prior studies that appeared to show health benefits from moderate drinking. The researchers identified several key biases in earlier studies: (1) inclusion of former drinkers in abstainer reference groups; (2) inadequate control for confounding factors; and (3) poor measurement of alcohol consumption. When these methodological issues were addressed, the apparent protective effect of moderate alcohol consumption disappeared. This study is particularly important as it helps explain contradictory findings in the alcohol research literature.

A key finding was that studies reporting higher mean relative risk estimates of all-cause mortality for low-volume drinkers shared certain characteristics. These included the use of younger cohorts, exclusion of participants with current or prior ill health, assessment of alcohol use for less than 30 days, avoidance of abstainer bias in reference groups, and proper control for both smoking status and socioeconomic factors.

### 4. Zhao et al. (2023) - Association Between Daily Alcohol Intake and Risk of All-Cause Mortality

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 1.3-24.9 g/day (approximately 1-2 standard drinks)
* **Sample Size**: Meta-analysis of 107 cohort studies involving more than 4.8 million participants
* **Key Correlations**: Examined effects of age, smoking, socioeconomic status, and other health factors
* **Key Finding**: When analyzing only studies with no methodological issues, low or moderate alcohol intake was not significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk compared with abstention from alcohol.

This comprehensive meta-analysis confirmed that many prior studies showing protective effects of moderate drinking suffered from methodological flaws. When these flaws were addressed, the apparent benefits disappeared. The study also found that moderate alcohol consumption might be more harmful for younger adults than for older adults.

### 5. Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction (CCSA) Guidelines Update (2022)

:warning: Volunteer needed to review this study.

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 1-2 standard drinks per week
* **Sample Size**: Comprehensive review of existing studies
* **Key Correlations**: Examined associations between alcohol consumption and various health outcomes including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and liver disease
* **Key Finding**: Updated guidelines indicated that health risks begin with the first drink, and the risk of seven types of cancer increases at less than 2 standard drinks per week. Their evidence review concluded that no amount of alcohol consumption is beneficial to health.

Canada's updated guidance represents one of the most restrictive national guidelines globally, recommending that adults limit consumption to 2 standard drinks per week to minimize health risks. This is a dramatic reduction from their previous guidelines (2011) which recommended no more than 10 drinks per week for women and 15 drinks per week for men.

### 6. U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2020-2025

:warning: Volunteer needed to review this study.

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Up to 1 drink per day for women and up to 2 drinks per day for men
* **Sample Size**: Comprehensive review of existing research
* **Key Correlations**: Examined relationships between alcohol consumption, socioeconomic factors, and various health outcomes
* **Key Finding**: Adults of legal drinking age can choose not to drink or to drink in moderation by limiting intake to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women. The guidelines emphasize that "drinking less is better for health than drinking more."

The U.S. guidelines, while more permissive than some other countries, still emphasize that alcohol consumption should be limited and that there are no health benefits that cannot be obtained through other means. The guidelines specifically note that those who do not drink should not begin drinking for any reason.

### 6. Burton & Sheron (2018) - No Level of Alcohol Consumption Improves Health

:warning: Volunteer needed to review this study.

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Any alcohol consumption
* **Sample Size**: Review of multiple studies
* **Key Finding**: Concluded that the protective effects attributed to low-volume alcohol consumption in previous studies were likely the result of methodological errors. When these errors were corrected, no level of alcohol consumption was found to improve health.

### 7. Griswold et al. (2022) - Population-level risks of alcohol consumption by amount

:warning: Volunteer needed to review this study.

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: 0.1-20 g/day (up to approximately 1.5 standard drinks)
* **Sample Size**: Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2020, covering global population
* **Key Finding**: Found that the theoretical minimum risk exposure level for alcohol consumption is zero, and that low levels of consumption are causally related to several health outcomes including various types of cancer.

### 7. Meta-Analysis on Cardiovascular Disease (Di Castelnuovo et al., 2022)

:warning: Volunteer needed to review this study.

* **Definition of Low Consumption**: Up to 12g per day (approximately 1 standard drink)
* **Sample Size**: Meta-analysis of multiple studies including over 1 million participants
* **Key Correlations**: Examined relationships between alcohol consumption, age, sex, and cardiovascular outcomes
* **Key Finding**: Low alcohol consumption (≤12g/day) was associated with a modest reduction in cardiovascular disease risk, but this benefit disappeared at higher consumption levels and was outweighed by increased risks of other health problems.

This meta-analysis is notable for suggesting some potential cardiovascular benefits from very low levels of alcohol consumption, particularly for older adults. However, the authors emphasized that these benefits are modest, specific to certain populations, and must be weighed against increased risks of cancer, liver disease, and other health problems even at low consumption levels.

## Conclusion

The current scientific consensus, based on the most methodologically rigorous studies, indicates that there is no completely "safe" level of alcohol consumption that is free from any increased health risk. While the absolute increase in risk at very low levels of consumption (e.g., 1-2 drinks per week) may be small, the evidence no longer supports claims that moderate drinking provides health benefits that outweigh its risks for most people.

The shift in scientific understanding has led many health organizations to revise their guidelines, moving away from recommendations of "safe" drinking levels toward acknowledgment that the lowest risk comes with zero alcohol consumption. However, these organizations also recognize that many adults will continue to drink alcohol, and thus provide guidelines to limit harm rather than eliminate it entirely.

Individuals should make informed decisions about alcohol consumption based on personal health factors, family history, and their own risk tolerance, ideally in consultation with healthcare providers.
