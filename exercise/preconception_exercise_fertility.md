# Preconception Physical Activity and Fertility in Women and Men (Evidence Review)

Scope and inclusion
- Focus: Exercise habits or structured interventions initiated before conception (preconception) or while trying to conceive.
- Population: Generally healthy adults (including sedentary) in the healthy-weight range (roughly BMI 18.5–29.9). Excludes cohorts restricted to obesity, underweight, PCOS-only, or other specific medical conditions.
- Exclusions: Studies limited to exercise during pregnancy; infertility clinic populations unless clearly generalizable to the healthy general population; disease-specific cohorts.
- Outcomes: Fecundability (time-to-pregnancy), conception rates, semen quality/functional markers in healthy men, and any couple-level fecundability signals.

Quick gist (what the best evidence suggests)
- Women: Regular moderate-to-vigorous leisure-time activity before conception is generally neutral-to-beneficial for fecundability; very strenuous volumes may not confer additional benefit and can be counterproductive if they induce energy deficit/menstrual disturbance.
- Men: Habitual moderate-to-vigorous activity is associated with better semen parameters; prolonged cycling at higher weekly volumes may be detrimental.
- Couples: Large preconception cohorts suggest a small positive association of women's vigorous activity with fecundability, little to no association for men's overall activity, with possible adverse signal for high-volume cycling.

Note: "Exercise" below reflects leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) categories used in the studies: moderate (e.g., brisk walking, easy cycling, doubles tennis) and vigorous (e.g., running, aerobics, lap swimming, fast cycling).



Top 3 most robust articles

1) Wesselink et al. (PRESTO) – Physical activity and fecundability in a North American preconception cohort
- Population and design: Prospective cohort of pregnancy planners (PRESTO) in North America; healthy adults trying to conceive naturally; followed up to 12 cycles.
- Exercise exposure:
  - Self-reported hours/week of moderate and vigorous LTPA before and during attempts.
  - Examples: Moderate (brisk walking, light cycling); vigorous (running/jogging, lap swimming, aerobic classes).
  - Typical categories: 0, 1–3, 4–6, ≥7 h/week (both moderate and vigorous assessed separately).
- Duration/frequency: Habitual weekly volumes reported at baseline and periodically.
- Main findings:
  - Women: Vigorous activity showed a modest positive association with fecundability (fecundability ratio [FR] approximately 1.1–1.2 for higher vs lower categories after adjustment). Moderate activity showed little association.
  - Men: Overall LTPA had little association with fecundability; however, higher weekly bicycling showed a possible adverse association.
- Methodology: Prospective cohort with time-to-pregnancy models (discrete-time proportional probabilities), extensive confounder adjustment (age, BMI, smoking, alcohol, intercourse frequency, menstrual characteristics, and more).
- Limitations:
  - Self-reported PA, potential misclassification.
  - Residual confounding from unmeasured health behaviors cannot be fully excluded.
  - Observational design (cannot prove causation).
- Positive effects: Women's vigorous PA associated with slightly shorter time-to-pregnancy; no signal of harm for moderate activity.
- Negative effects: Male high-volume cycling possibly associated with lower fecundability.

2) Mikkelsen/Wise/Hatch et al. (Snart-Gravid, Denmark) – Female LTPA and time-to-pregnancy
- Population and design: Prospective preconception internet-based Danish cohort (Snart-Gravid) of healthy women 18–40 attempting conception.
- Exercise exposure:
  - Weekly hours of moderate and vigorous LTPA before conception.
  - Examples: Moderate (brisk walking, easy biking); vigorous (running, aerobics).
- Duration/frequency: Habitual weekly categories (similar cutoffs to above studies).
- Main findings:
  - Moderate LTPA generally neutral; vigorous LTPA not harmful among healthy-weight women and in some analyses associated with higher fecundability.
  - Strongest benefits were sometimes more evident in higher-BMI subgroups ([more info here](exercise_impacts_on_obese_women.mb)), but no evidence of harm in healthy-weight women at typical volumes.
- Methodology: Prospective time-to-pregnancy analysis with discrete-time models; adjustment for age, BMI, parity, smoking, caffeine/alcohol, cycle regularity, intercourse frequency, and socioeconomic factors.
- Limitations:
  - Self-reported PA and potential recall bias.
  - Potential selection bias in internet-based recruitment.
  - Observational (no causal inference).
- Positive effects: No adverse effect of moderate/vigorous LTPA in healthy-weight women; possible modest improvement in fecundability with vigorous activity.
- Negative effects: Very strenuous exercise without adequate energy intake may disrupt cycles (general physiologic consideration; not a central finding in healthy-weight subgroup here).

3) Gaskins et al. (Rochester Young Men Study) – Physical activity, TV watching, and semen quality in healthy young men
- Population and design: Cross-sectional study of healthy, college-aged men (community sample, not fertility patients).
- Exercise exposure:
  - Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) hours/week; common activities included running, weight training, recreational sports.
  - Sedentary behavior captured via TV watching hours/week.
- Duration/frequency: Categories such as <5, 5–14, ≥15 h/week MVPA; and TV watching <5, 5–19, ≥20 h/week.
- Main findings:
  - Men with ≥15 h/week MVPA had higher sperm concentration and total sperm count versus <5 h/week.
  - Higher TV watching was associated with lower sperm concentration.
- Methodology: Cross-sectional; semen analysis per WHO criteria; adjusted for age, BMI, abstinence time, smoking, and other covariates.
- Limitations:
  - Cross-sectional (cannot determine causality or time-to-pregnancy).
  - Young convenience sample; generalizability to older men uncertain.
  - Self-reported MVPA and TV time.
- Positive effects: Higher habitual MVPA associated with better semen indices.
- Negative effects: High sedentary time (TV) associated with poorer semen indices.

A) Gudmundsdottir et al. – Leisure-time PA and subfertility in the HUNT Study (Norway)
- Design: Large population-based cohort; healthy women of reproductive age; self-reported LTPA and later subfertility indicators including time-to-pregnancy.
- Exercise: Frequency/intensity categories from sedentary to vigorous activity.
- Findings: U-shaped pattern in some analyses—lowest subfertility with moderate activity; very low or very high extremes linked to higher subfertility indicators. Within typical, sustainable volumes, no harm signal.
- Methods/limits: Prospective with large N; self-report PA; observational; potential residual confounding.

B) Nurses' Health Study II – Physical activity and ovulatory disorder infertility
- Design: Large prospective cohort of healthy women; outcome was incident ovulatory disorder infertility (a specific, clinically defined subtype).
- Exercise: Self-reported vigorous and moderate LTPA.
- Findings: Higher vigorous activity associated with lower risk of ovulatory infertility overall; among very lean women, extremely high volumes could be associated with menstrual disturbance if energy deficit present (contextual).
- Methods/limits: Prospective; robust covariate control; outcome is infertility subtype rather than time-to-pregnancy; observational.

C) PRESTO (male analysis) – Male PA, cycling, and fecundability
- Design: Prospective preconception cohort including male partners.
- Exercise: Self-reported moderate/vigorous LTPA; specific query on cycling hours/week.
- Findings: Overall male PA largely null for fecundability; high-volume bicycling associated with lower fecundability in some analyses.
- Methods/limits: Same as PRESTO; self-report; observational; possible confounding by other endurance-lifestyle factors.

D) Endurance cycling vs other sports – Semen parameters in healthy men
- Design: Cross-sectional comparisons of cyclists vs runners/swimmers or non-athletes.
- Exercise: Predominant mode (cycling vs other), weekly volume, years of participation.
- Findings: More frequent/increased-volume cycling associated with lower sperm concentration/motility in some studies; runners/swimmers not showing similar detriment.
- Methods/limits: Cross-sectional; sport-specific self-selection; limited confounder control in some studies; not designed for time-to-pregnancy.
- Citation: Vaamonde D and colleagues (various). Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19042395/

E) Leisure-time PA and fecundability (additional Danish/US cohorts)
- Design: Prospective cohorts of healthy pregnancy planners (internet-based).
- Exercise: Hours/week of moderate and vigorous LTPA prior to conception.
- Findings: Generally neutral-to-positive associations of vigorous activity with fecundability; moderate activity largely neutral; patterns consistent across settings.
- Methods/limits: Observational; self-report PA; careful but not exhaustive control.
- Citation: Wise LA, Hatch EE, Rothman KJ, et al. Additional cohort publications. Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22258620/

F) Sedentary time and semen quality – Beyond TV watching
- Design: Observational studies in healthy men evaluating sitting time/sedentary behaviors.
- Exercise: Objective or self-reported sedentary time; MVPA volume.
- Findings: Higher sedentary time associated with poorer semen parameters independent of MVPA in some analyses; supports minimizing long sitting bouts.
- Methods/limits: Cross-sectional; device vs self-report heterogeneity; not linked directly to fecundability.
- Citation: Representative example linking sedentary time and semen quality in healthy men. Link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31390358/



What to do (practical, neutral takeaways consistent with evidence)

For couples trying to conceive
- Do:
  - Aim for regular moderate-to-vigorous activity most days of the week (e.g., 150–300 min/week moderate, or 75–150 min/week vigorous, or a mix).
  - Include a couple of sessions of vigorous work if you already tolerate it (jogging, interval running, lap swimming, fast cycling, circuits).
  - Break up long sitting time—especially for the guy on the couch. Less binging on TV; more walking breaks. Your swimmers prefer sprints to marathons… on the remote.
- Don't:
  - For men: Avoid very high weekly volumes of cycling (e.g., multiple hours most days) or long, hot saddle time without breaks; consider swapping some sessions for running, rowing, or swimming.
  - For women: Avoid suddenly jumping to extreme volumes or intensities without adequate fueling and rest—energy deficits can affect cycles. Build up gradually.

Potential positive effects observed
- Women: Slightly higher fecundability with habitual vigorous LTPA; no harm with moderate volumes in healthy-weight women.
- Men: Better semen concentration and total count with higher MVPA; less sedentary time associated with better indices.

Potential negative effects observed
- Men: High-volume cycling may adversely affect semen parameters and, in some prospective analyses, fecundability.
- Women: At extreme volumes/intensities without adequate caloric intake, risk of menstrual disturbance (athlete triad/RED-S physiology)—mitigated by sensible programming and fueling.

Methodological caveats across the literature
- Most evidence is observational (prospective cohorts are strongest here). Associations are modest; causation isn't guaranteed.
- Physical activity is self-reported in many cohorts; misclassification typically biases toward null.
- Where male outcomes are semen parameters (cross-sectional), translation to actual time-to-pregnancy is inferred, not directly proven.
