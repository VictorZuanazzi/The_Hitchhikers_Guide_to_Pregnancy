Randomized Trial of a Lifestyle Program in Obese Infertile Women (LIFEstyle Study) [Mutsaerts 2016](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1506991)
- Population: 577 obese infertile women (BMI ≥29) randomized in the Netherlands to 6 months of preconception lifestyle intervention vs prompt infertility treatment.
- Exercise description:
  - Part of a multi-component lifestyle program: individualized counseling to increase daily physical activity (e.g., brisk walking, cycling), step-count goals, and behavior change support; exercise chosen to be moderate-intensity and sustainable.
- Duration and frequency:
  - Targeted daily activity (e.g., step goals) and multiple weekly sessions of moderate-intensity activity over a 6-month preconception period; the exercise was home/community-based with counseling follow-up.
- Methodology:
  - Randomized controlled trial (multicenter); primary endpoint live birth within 24 months.
  - Limitations: Exercise not isolated from diet/behavior components; adherence variability; not powered primarily for pregnancy complication subtypes; generalizability limited to obese infertile women.
- Main findings:
  - Live birth within 24 months: no overall superiority of lifestyle-first vs prompt treatment.
  - More spontaneous (natural) conceptions occurred in the lifestyle group, and fewer women required fertility treatments.
  - Significant weight loss and metabolic improvements occurred preconception.
  - Pregnancy complication outcomes showed trends but were not consistently different (secondary outcomes, limited power).
- Positive effects:
  - Weight loss, improved cardiometabolic health, more natural conceptions, reduced need for assisted treatment.
- Negative effects/risks:
  - Delay in initiating fertility treatment; potential burden of behavior change; exercise-related minor musculoskeletal complaints possible though not highlighted as serious adverse events.

OWL–PCOS Trial: Preconception Lifestyle Modification prior to Ovulation Induction in Obese Women with PCOS [Legro 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27571051/)

- Population: Obese infertile women with PCOS randomized to preconception lifestyle modification (diet + exercise), oral contraceptive pretreatment, or combined, followed by standardized ovulation induction.
- Exercise description:
  - Structured counseling to increase moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (e.g., brisk walking) with caloric restriction and behavior strategies.
- Duration and frequency:
  - Approximately 16 weeks of preconception lifestyle intervention before pharmacologic ovulation induction; goals typically aligned with ≥150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity.
- Methodology:
  - Randomized controlled trial; primary outcomes included ovulation and live birth after subsequent ovulation induction.
  - Limitations: Exercise embedded within multi-component weight-loss program; PCOS-only population; center-specific supports could affect adherence; not designed to test labour outcomes.
- Main findings:
  - Lifestyle-first groups had improved metabolic parameters and higher ovulation rates; live birth rates improved when lifestyle modification preceded ovulation induction compared to immediate induction alone.
  - Some pregnancies occurred without needing escalation.
- Positive effects:
  - Better insulin sensitivity, higher ovulation and clinical pregnancy chances, potential improvement in live birth when combined with subsequent induction.
- Negative effects/risks:
  - Time to treatment initiation increased; adherence challenges; generalizability limited to women with PCOS and obesity.

## Body mass index, physical activity, and fecundability in a North American preconception cohort

:warning: Volunteer needed to review this study.

- Population & design: Prospective preconception cohort (PRESTO) of healthy pregnancy planners in the US/Canada; time-to-pregnancy followed up to 12 cycles.
- Exercise description:
  - Women’s self-reported LTPA categorized by intensity and hours/week; typical examples: walking, cycling, running, aerobics/fitness.
- Duration & frequency: Habitual weekly categories for moderate and vigorous PA at baseline preconception.
- Main findings:
  - Moderate PA was associated with improved fecundability overall after adjustment.
  - Associations for vigorous PA varied by BMI in stratified analyses; among healthy-weight women, neutral to modestly positive associations were observed without evidence of harm at typical volumes.
- Methodology: Prospective cohort; discrete-time models; robust covariate adjustment (age, BMI, smoking, alcohol/caffeine, intercourse frequency, menstrual characteristics, parity, education).
- Limitations:
  - Self-reported PA; measurement error.
  - Observational; possible residual confounding.
  - Some subgroup findings may be underpowered.
- Positive effects: Moderate preconception PA beneficial/neutral for time-to-pregnancy in healthy-weight women; no harm with typical vigorous volumes.
- Negative effects: Very high vigorous volumes may not add benefit and could be counterproductive in energy-deficient contexts.
