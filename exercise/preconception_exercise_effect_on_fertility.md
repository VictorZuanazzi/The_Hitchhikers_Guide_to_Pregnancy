# Preconception Physical Activity and Fertility

> **The Gist**: Two to three hours a week of moderate exercise for her and higher intensity for you will help. 
> For her: moderate exercising won't harm. A triathlon while trying to get pregnant is an unadvisable combination. 2 to 3 hours a week of yoga, jogging, or walking keeps you healthy and does not lower your chances. If you push yourself too hard, it might impact your menstrual cycle, _moderate_ is the word you want to pay attention to.
> For him: Your swimmers exercise with you! A mixture of cardio and strength training improve your chances, especially if you are using that to replace TV time. A football with friends on weekends, swimming before work, hitting the gym a couple of days a week are all recommended. Just be careful with long cycling trips and tight underware, you don't want to cook your boys. Three to five hours a week of mixed cardio and strength training will do you well.

Having sex more often helps your chances to conceive. Captivating good looks will help s with having sex more often. Exercise helps in captivating those looks, the right curves in the right places if you get my drift. Exercise is also just healthy for you. The research done on couples shows "neutral-to-beneficial" causation between exercise and time to fecundability, that is nerd speak for "it won't harm, it might help". However, exercise impacts men and women differently.

For women trying to conceive, being regularly active before pregnancy is neutral-to-beneficial for your chances of conceiving per cycle. Prospective preconception cohorts that followed women from “we’re trying” until pregnancy found that moderate-to-vigorous leisure-time activity was linked to slightly higher fecundability (time-to-pregnancy), with no harm at typical, sustainable volumes. Habitual moderate-to-vigorous activity before conception is neutral-to-beneficial for fecundability; sudden extreme volumes without adequate fueling/rest can impair cycles. Build toward ≥150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming) or include 75–150 minutes/week vigorous sessions if accustomed; add 1–2 days/week light-to-moderate resistance training.

For men trying to conceive, more overall moderate-to-vigorous activity and less sedentary time associated with better semen quality; high-volume cycling may be detrimental. Practical guidance for healthy men:
- Do regular, moderate-to-vigorous activity: Aim for 150–300 min/week moderate OR 75–150 min/week vigorous, plus 2 days/week of resistance work. This is neutral-to-beneficial for fertility and overall health.
- Break up long sitting: High TV time is repeatedly linked to poorer semen quality—stand, walk, or do brief mobility every 30–60 minutes.
- Go easy on high-volume cycling: If you clock many saddle hours, moderate volume, optimize fit/saddle, use padded shorts, and cross-train (running, rowing, swimming).
- Mind the heat: Avoid hot tubs/saunas and prolonged heat exposure (including on-bike perineal pressure and tight, insulating gear). Keep the boys cool.
- Support recovery: Sleep, adequate energy and protein, and avoid extreme, sudden jumps in endurance load.

For couples, if you are already doing it together, you may also just do it together. Find an exercise you two enjoy doing together and keep each other to it. Even just going for walks together will help. Maybe enroll for dance classes such as bachata or tango? That might add some extra romance as well :wink:  

Now, let's look at the evidence where that info came from.

## Geen zin in. What is the minimum amount of exercise that you can get away with?

For the couch potatoes wanting to bring small couch potatoes to the world, what is the minimum amount of exercise that improves your chances?  

For women that are not obese nor underweight, the research suggests that you may get away with no exercise at all! If you want to improve your chances, add some walking to your routine, for instance, replace that 5-min drive with a walk. Exercises that strengthen the hips and pelvis are beneficial during pregnancy, you may want to already start with an hour of yoga a week, or whatever other exercise you can tolerate. 

The evidence for men is less lenient. There is evidence suggesting sitting time negatively affects your swimmers, and physical activity may give them a good boost. Braking the sedentary time might be where most benefits come from. For example, going for a 10 min walk before work, at lunch, and after work. Walking or cycling instead of driving or taking public transport may also give you some extra benefits. That said, the evidence favours adding an hour or two a week of moderate exercises (a friendly football match, easy laps swimming) mixing cardio and strength training.

## The most relevant (and reviewed) studies for HER fertility

### A prospective cohort study of physical activity and time-to-pregnancy

This is a prospective study that followed a cohort of healthy women attempting natural conception, for up to 12 cycles (time-to-pregnancy modeling) in the danish Snart-Gravid internet-based cohort. The researchers sent a survey to the women every two months with questions regarding sex frequency, physical activity, and other habits. Examples explicitly included walking, cycling, running/jogging, aerobics/fitness classes.

Main findings:
- 2 hours / week of moderate physical activity increases the fecundability chances by 15%. 
- 5 hours / week or more of moderate physica increases the fecundability chances by 18%.
- Vigorous PA is detrimental to fecundability in almost all cases, except for obese women (BMS > 25).

This study has two main limitations: Self-reported PA over a lengthy period of time (12 months). And the observational design cannot prove causation; residual confounding is possible. For instance, women that did have time (and money) to go to the gym might have general lower stress levels than women who, for many possible reasons, did not.

### Physical activity and fertility in women

Large population-based Norwegian cohort; healthy women of reproductive age (<45 yo); assessed physical activity and subfertility indicators including time-to-pregnancy. This study finds evidence against intense exercise for women trying to conceive, but no evidence for moderate exercise.

The study includes a rather large sample (3887 women), however, the findings are based on a questionare (self-report!) sent in 1995. No smartwatches to help you remember the last time you went for a walk.

## The most relevant (and reviewed) studies for HIS fertility

### Comprehensive review of physical activity and male fertility

Narrative review synthesizing human evidence on PA, semen parameters, fertility, and pregnancy outcomes. 

Main findings:
- Moderate PA is generally associated with neutral-to-beneficial semen parameters and hormonal balance.
- Men in the top quartile of moderate-to-vigorous exercise had 43% higher sperm concentrations than men in the bottom quartile.
- Exercises that were found to increase sperm concentrations the most were outdoor exercises (>1.5h/week) by 42%.
- The evidence on weightlifting is mixed, one study shows a 25% increase in sperm concentration for at least 2h/week, but other studies show a detrimental effect on concentration and sperm count.
- Several studies have found cycling to be detrimental to fertility. One of them shows that 1.5h/week of cycling lowers sperm concentration by 34% compared to not cycling.
- Very high-volume endurance training and high-volume cycling show the most consistent signals of detriment (e.g., lower counts or motility), likely via heat and perineal pressure. Very high-volume is defined as at least two hours of exercise per day for 5 days a week.
- Several control trial studies support that exercising increases the chances of pregnancy considerably when compared to sedentary. Conceiving rates for men performing moderate physical activity are 6 to 80 times higher than for sedentary men.

### Review: Impact of physical activity on semen quality

- Design: Systematic review focusing on PA’s influence on semen quality, reclassifying by fertility status.
- The main finding of the review is the lack of standards in the methodologies for studying the impact of PA on semen quality. The authors note that different definitions of exercise intensity as well as different methods for calculating semen characteristics make it impractical to draw scientifically sound conclusions.

### Meta-analysis: Effects of physical activity on fertility parameters

- Design: Quantitative synthesis/meta-analysis of PA and male fertility parameters.
- Findings (broadly): PA associated with improvements in certain semen parameters; heterogeneity by modality/intensity with caution for high-volume endurance/cycling.
- Limitations: Aggregates heterogeneous designs; some included studies involve non-healthy samples—apply findings specifically to healthy cohorts with caution.

Exercises included in the review:
1. 150 min of moderate activity or 75 min of vigorous exercise per week -> improved semen quality
2. 3x week of 15 min warmup, 40 min treadmill at 70% peak heart rate + 10 min cooling down = 20 min low intensity + 40 min high intensity = 1h + 2h/week -> improved semen quality
3. 10 min warmup + 35min walking/running + 35min strength training (moderate to high intensity) -> improved natural pregancy & live birth
4. 3x week 50 min treadmill moderate to high intensity + 10 min cooldown + 10 min warming up -> improved natural birth * live birth
5. 3-6x week moderate treadmill 25-45 min -> improved natural birth & live birt

"A statistically significant relationship between physical exercise and sperm concentration (p=0.02), total sperm motility (p<0.01), total sperm count (p<0.01), normal morphology (p<0.01) has been established. Moreover, the study registered a statistically significant association within physical activity and total pregnancy rate (p<0.01) and live birth rate (p<0.01)."

## The skeptical take on exercise and fertility

It is important to mention that the scientific community is yet to converge on a consensus on the effects of exercise on fertility. Two scientific reviews have found inconsistent results, and caution the conclusions of previous studies might be pre-mature.

1. [Xu et al. 2024](https://journals.lww.com/ajandrology/fulltext/2025/09000/impact_of_physical_activity_on_semen_quality__a.4.aspx) performed a systematic review focusing on PA’s influence on semen quality. The main finding of the review is the lack of standards in the methodologies for studying the impact of PA on semen quality. The authors note that different definitions of exercise intensity as well as different methods for calculating semen characteristics make it impractical to draw scientifically sound conclusions.

2. [Brinson et al. 2023](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7614776/) investigated impacts of physical activity and fertility on men and women in a narrative review (only 34 studies considered). The authors conclude that "The association between spontaneous fertility and physical activity in both males and females remains unclear, while the association with sedentary behavior remains largely unexplored.". Specifically for women it is possible that physical activity may result in energy deficit, and inhibit the process required for ovulation to occur. However, there is enough scietific body to support that regular and moderate physical activity improves chances of achieving optimal hormonal balance and regular ovulation, which enhances fertility. 

The skepticism is not unfounded. Biologically, exercises may affect energy and stress levels, hormonal cycles, and libido. Running, for example, improves stamina and hurts your knee. There is evidence that exercises can be beneficial, but how much and which types of exercises will vary from person to person.

- Design: Literature review emphasizing intensity gradients.
- Findings: Moderate-intensity training generally favorable; high-intensity/high-volume endurance may impair motility/count via heat, oxidative stress, and energy availability pathways.
- Limitations: Narrative, not meta-analytic; includes non-healthy and athletic extremes—applied here to healthy adults cautiously.

- Design: Cross-sectional study among healthy, young, non-fathers.
- Exercise description: Self-reported PA levels; general aerobic activities typical for young adults.
- Duration/frequency: Hours per week categories (as per study questionnaire).
- Findings: PA associated with differences in sperm motility profiles (e.g., altered immotile sperm percentage); no consistent major deficits at moderate levels.
- Methodology limitations: Cross-sectional; self-report; specific demographic (young, lean, educated) may limit generalizability.

### Male personal heat exposures and fecundability (preconception)

- Design: Prospective preconception cohort; male heat exposure index vs fecundability.
- Relevance to exercise: Supports mechanism where scrotal heat (e.g., prolonged cycling, hot environments) can reduce fecundability; complements cycling findings.
- Findings: Greater cumulative heat exposure associated with moderate reduction in fecundability, especially ≥30 years.
- Limitations: Exposure misclassification possible; observational.
- Fertility and time-to-pregnancy:
  - Women: Cohorts in healthy populations suggest vigorous preconception activity may modestly improve fecundability (PRESTO 2018), while moderate activity appears neutral—so add some intensity if you’re already comfortable. Avoid extreme training loads if lean and not accustomed.
  - Men: An RCT shows 24 weeks of regular aerobic training (3–4x/week, 30–45 min, moderate intensity) improves semen quality; observational work supports benefits of vigorous PA and cautions
