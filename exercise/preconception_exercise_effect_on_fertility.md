# Preconception Physical Activity and Fertility

> **The Gist**: Two to three hours a week of moderate exercise for her and higher intensity for you will help. 
> For her: moderate exercising won't harm. A triathlon while trying to get pregnant is an unadvisable combination. 2 to 3 hours a week of yoga, jogging, or walking keeps you healthy and does not lower your chances. If you push yourself too hard, it might impact your menstrual cycle, _moderate_ is the word you want to pay attention to.
> For him: Your swimmers exercise with you! A mixture of cardio and strength training improve your chances, especially if you are using that to replace TV time. A football with friends on weekends, swimming before work, hitting the gym a couple of days a week are all recommended. Just be careful with long cycling trips and tight underware, you don't want to cook your boys. Three to five hours a week of mixed cardio and strength training will do you well.

Having sex more often helps your chances to conceive. Captivating good looks will help s with having sex more often. Exercise helps in captivating those looks, the right curves in the right places if you get my drift. Exercise is also just healthy for you. The research done on couples shows "neutral-to-beneficial" causation between exercise and time to fecundability, that is nerd speak for "it won't harm, it might help". However, exercise impacts men and women differently.

For women trying to conceive, being regularly active before pregnancy is neutral-to-beneficial for your chances of conceiving per cycle. Prospective preconception cohorts that followed women from “we’re trying” until pregnancy found that moderate-to-vigorous leisure-time activity was linked to slightly higher fecundability (time-to-pregnancy), with no harm at typical, sustainable volumes. Habitual moderate-to-vigorous activity before conception is neutral-to-beneficial for fecundability; sudden extreme volumes without adequate fueling/rest can impair cycles. Build toward ≥150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming) or include 75–150 minutes/week vigorous sessions if accustomed; add 1–2 days/week light-to-moderate resistance training.

For men trying to conceive, more overall moderate-to-vigorous activity and less sedentary time associated with better semen quality; high-volume cycling may be detrimental. Practical guidance for healthy men:
- Do regular, moderate-to-vigorous activity: Aim for 150–300 min/week moderate OR 75–150 min/week vigorous, plus 2 days/week of resistance work. This is neutral-to-beneficial for fertility and overall health.
- Break up long sitting: High TV time is repeatedly linked to poorer semen quality—stand, walk, or do brief mobility every 30–60 minutes.
- Go easy on high-volume cycling: If you clock many saddle hours, moderate volume, optimize fit/saddle, use padded shorts, and cross-train (running, rowing, swimming).
- Mind the heat: Avoid hot tubs/saunas and prolonged heat exposure (including on-bike perineal pressure and tight, insulating gear). Keep the boys cool.
- Support recovery: Sleep, adequate energy and protein, and avoid extreme, sudden jumps in endurance load.

For couples, if you are already doing it together, you may also just do it together. Find an exercise you two enjoy doing together and keep each other to it. Even just going for walks together will help.

Now, let's look at the evidence where that info came from.

## The most relevant (and reviewed) studies

### Physical activity and fertility 

This is perhaps the only narrative scientific review linking exercise and fertility for healthy men and women. The conclusions from the 34 studies is underwelming "association between spontaneous fertility and physical activity [...] remains unclear, while [...] with sedentary behavior remains largely unexplored". 

The authors note that more evidence is needed to for a causal relationship between exercise levels (and sedentary time) and fertility. Read the following quotes with this note in mind.

"It is possible that high levels of physical activity among females could result in an energy deficit, inhibit the processes required for ovulation to occur, and ultimately hinder one’s fertility. On the other hand, research has also suggested regular, moderate physical activity may aid in achieving optimal hormonal balance and regular ovulation, thus enhancing fertility."

"High levels of stress and anxiety can decrease male testosterone levels leading to a halt in spermatogenesis. Given that physical activity has been shown to decrease stress and anxiety levels, it is possible that anxious or stressed males may be able to minimize their symptoms through physical activity, which could improve their fertility."

Let's dig deeper.

## Additional (reviewed) studies for her fetility

### A prospective cohort study of physical activity and time-to-pregnancy

This is a prospective study that followed a cohort of healthy women attempting natural conception, for up to 12 cycles (time-to-pregnancy modeling) in the danish Snart-Gravid internet-based cohort. The researchers sent a questionaire to the women every two months with questions regarding sex frequency, physical activity, and other habits.  Examples explicitly included walking, cycling, running/jogging, aerobics/fitness classes.

Main findings:
- Moderate PA was associated with a small increase in fecundability overall. 
- Vigorous PA showed heterogeneity by body composition in sensitivity analyses; in lean women, high volumes of vigorous activity could be associated with reduced fecundability, whereas no harm was evident at moderate volumes.

This study has two main limitations: Self-reported PA over a lengthy period of time (2 months). And the observational design cannot prove causation; residual confounding is possible. For instance, women that did have time (and money) to go to the gym might have general lower stress levels than women who, for many possible reasons, did not.

### Physical activity and fertility in women

Large population-based Norwegian cohort; healthy women of reproductive age (<45 yo); assessed physical activity and subfertility indicators including time-to-pregnancy. This study finds evidence against intense exercise for women trying to conceive, but no evidence for moderate exercise.

The study includes a rather large sample (3887 women), however, the findings are based on a questionare (self-report!) sent in 1995. No smartwatches to help you remember the last time you went for a walk.

- Positive vs negative effects:
  - Positive: Moderate PA supports better overall reproductive profile in healthy men.
  - Negative: High-volume cycling/endurance may impair some parameters.
- Limitations: Heterogeneity in exposures/outcomes; many observational studies; some included clinical or infertile cohorts—interpretation here focuses on healthy-sample findings.

- Design: Prospective preconception cohort; male heat exposure index vs fecundability.
- Relevance to exercise: Supports mechanism where scrotal heat (e.g., prolonged cycling, hot environments) can reduce fecundability; complements cycling findings.
- Findings: Greater cumulative heat exposure associated with moderate reduction in fecundability, especially ≥30 years.
- Limitations: Exposure misclassification possible; observational.


- Fertility and time-to-pregnancy:
  - Women: Cohorts in healthy populations suggest vigorous preconception activity may modestly improve fecundability (PRESTO 2018), while moderate activity appears neutral—so add some intensity if you’re already comfortable. Avoid extreme training loads if lean and not accustomed.
  - Men: An RCT shows 24 weeks of regular aerobic training (3–4x/week, 30–45 min, moderate intensity) improves semen quality; observational work supports benefits of vigorous PA and cautions
