# Preconception Physical Activity and Fertility

> **The Gist**: 


- Outcomes of interest: fertility/conception, maternal comfort/wellbeing, and pregnancy complications (e.g., GDM, hypertensive disorders), plus any labour/delivery effects if reported.

Note on “couples exercising together”
- Direct randomized trials testing partner-based or couple-coordinated exercise programs before conception are scarce. Most robust evidence examines individuals; some studies address male exercise and semen quality.
- Where available, we flag studies with partner involvement or implications for both partners. Couples can still adopt the same programs together for adherence and shared benefits—like spotting each other, just without dropping the baby.


For women trying to conceive, being regularly active before pregnancy is neutral-to-beneficial for your chances of conceiving per cycle. Prospective preconception cohorts that followed women from “we’re trying” until pregnancy found that moderate-to-vigorous leisure-time activity was linked to slightly higher fecundability (time-to-pregnancy), with no harm at typical, sustainable volumes.

- Outcomes: Fecundability (time-to-pregnancy), conception rates, and for men, semen quality or fecundability; couple-level fecundability where available.

Key gist (what the strongest evidence suggests)
- Women: Habitual moderate-to-vigorous activity before conception is neutral-to-beneficial for fecundability; sudden extreme volumes without adequate fueling/rest can impair cycles.
- Men: More overall moderate-to-vigorous activity and less sedentary time associated with better semen quality; high-volume cycling may be detrimental.
- Couples: Prospective preconception cohorts show modestly favorable or neutral associations of women’s activity with fecundability; male overall activity appears largely neutral for fecundability, with a negative signal for high-volume bicycling.

Note on “exercise” definitions used in these studies
- Moderate: brisk walking, casual cycling, doubles tennis, easy lap swimming, light aerobics.
- Vigorous: running/jogging, fast cycling/spin classes, high-intensity aerobics/intervals, lap swimming at higher intensity, competitive sports.
- Most studies used leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) self-report in hours/week within categories.

Practical takeaways for couples trying to conceive
- Aim for regular PA most days: about 150–300 min/week moderate, or 75–150 min/week vigorous, or a mix (plus 2 days/week of muscle-strengthening), built up gradually.
- Women: Moderate-to-vigorous LTPA appears neutral-to-beneficial for time-to-pregnancy when well-fueled; avoid sudden leaps to extreme volumes if you have a history of cycle sensitivity.
- Men: Keep up general MVPA and break up sedentary time; consider limiting high-volume weekly cycling (e.g., many hours over multiple days/week) while trying to conceive.
- Both: Favor sustainable routines you can maintain through the conception window; ensure adequate nutrition and sleep to support training.

Practical guidance for healthy men TTC (based on the above)
- Do regular, moderate-to-vigorous activity: Aim for 150–300 min/week moderate OR 75–150 min/week vigorous, plus 2 days/week of resistance work. This is neutral-to-beneficial for fertility and overall health.
- Break up long sitting: High TV time is repeatedly linked to poorer semen quality—stand, walk, or do brief mobility every 30–60 minutes.
- Go easy on high-volume cycling while TTC: If you clock many saddle hours, moderate volume, optimize fit/saddle, use padded shorts, and cross-train (running, rowing, swimming).
- Mind the heat: Avoid hot tubs/saunas and prolonged heat exposure (including on-bike perineal pressure and tight, insulating gear). Keep the boys cool.
- Support recovery: Sleep, adequate energy and protein, and avoid extreme, sudden jumps in endurance load.

- Women planning pregnancy:
  - Build toward ≥150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming) or include 75–150 minutes/week vigorous sessions if accustomed; add 1–2 days/week light-to-moderate resistance training.
- Men planning pregnancy:
  - 3–4 aerobic sessions/week at moderate intensity for ≥12–24 weeks; consider adding intervals; limit very high-volume cycling or optimize bike fit, cooling, and breaks; reduce prolonged sedentary time.
- Couples:
  - Shared brisk walks, runs, swims, or circuit classes; schedule activity in your calendars to increase adherence. Bonus points if you carry the groceries like a strongman to impress your future co-pilot.

- Population & design: Prospective preconception cohort of 3628 healthy women attempting natural conception, followed up to 12 cycles (time-to-pregnancy modeling) in the Snart-Gravid internet-based cohort (Denmark).
- Exercise description:
  - Self-reported leisure-time PA by intensity (moderate vs vigorous) and hours/week.
  - Examples explicitly included walking, cycling, running/jogging, aerobics/fitness classes.
- Duration & frequency: Habitual hours per week, reported in categories across moderate and vigorous intensities at baseline (preconception).
- Main findings:
  - Moderate PA was associated with a small increase in fecundability overall.
  - Vigorous PA showed heterogeneity by body composition in sensitivity analyses; in lean women, high volumes of vigorous activity could be associated with reduced fecundability, whereas no harm was evident at moderate volumes.
- Methodology: Prospective cohort; discrete-time proportional probabilities models for fecundability; extensive covariate adjustment (age, BMI, smoking, alcohol/caffeine, intercourse frequency, menstrual regularity, parity, education).
- Limitations:
  - Self-reported PA; misclassification likely biases toward the null.
  - Observational design cannot prove causation; residual confounding possible.
  - Internet-based recruitment may introduce selection bias.
- Positive effects: Moderate PA associated with improved fecundability; no evidence of harm at moderate levels in healthy-weight women.
- Negative effects: Very high vigorous volumes in lean women may be counterproductive (likely via energy deficiency/menstrual disturbance).

  - Positive: Moderate PA supports better overall reproductive profile in healthy men.
  - Negative: High-volume cycling/endurance may impair some parameters.
- Limitations: Heterogeneity in exposures/outcomes; many observational studies; some included clinical or infertile cohorts—interpretation here focuses on healthy-sample findings.

- Design: Cross-sectional study among healthy, young, non-fathers.
- Exercise description: Self-reported PA levels; general aerobic activities typical for young adults.
- Duration/frequency: Hours per week categories (as per study questionnaire).
- Findings: PA associated with differences in sperm motility profiles (e.g., altered immotile sperm percentage); no consistent major deficits at moderate levels.
- Methodology limitations: Cross-sectional; self-report; specific demographic (young, lean, educated) may limit generalizability.

### Male personal heat exposures and fecundability (preconception)
- Citation and link: Mínguez-Alarcón L, et al. (2023) Andrology. Male personal heat exposures and fecundability (Mínguez‑Alarcón 2023)[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/andr.13242].
- Design: Prospective preconception cohort; male heat exposure index vs fecundability.
- Relevance to exercise: Supports mechanism where scrotal heat (e.g., prolonged cycling, hot environments) can reduce fecundability; complements cycling findings.
- Findings: Greater cumulative heat exposure associated with moderate reduction in fecundability, especially ≥30 years.
- Limitations: Exposure misclassification possible; observational.


- Fertility and time-to-pregnancy:
  - Women: Cohorts in healthy populations suggest vigorous preconception activity may modestly improve fecundability (PRESTO 2018), while moderate activity appears neutral—so add some intensity if you’re already comfortable. Avoid extreme training loads if lean and not accustomed.
  - Men: An RCT shows 24 weeks of regular aerobic training (3–4x/week, 30–45 min, moderate intensity) improves semen quality; observational work supports benefits of vigorous PA and cautions
