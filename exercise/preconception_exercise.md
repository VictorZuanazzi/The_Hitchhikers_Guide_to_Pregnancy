# Preconception Exercise: Evidence for Fertility, Pregnancy Comfort, and Pregnancy/Labour Outcomes

:warning: in review :warning:
**Work in progress**

Scope and inclusion
- Focus: Exercise habits or structured interventions initiated before conception (preconception), or spanning preconception into early pregnancy.
- Population: Generally healthy adults planning pregnancy (not underweight, not obese; e.g., BMI roughly 18.5–29.9), including sedentary individuals starting activity.
- Excluded: Studies limited to exercise only during pregnancy; studies restricted to obese/underweight populations or specific disorders (e.g., PCOS-only) unless clearly generalizable to healthy-weight individuals.
- Outcomes of interest: fertility/conception, maternal comfort/wellbeing, and pregnancy complications (e.g., GDM, hypertensive disorders), plus any labour/delivery effects if reported.

Note on “couples exercising together”
- Direct randomized trials testing partner-based or couple-coordinated exercise programs before conception are scarce. Most robust evidence examines individuals; some studies address male exercise and semen quality.
- Where available, we flag studies with partner involvement or implications for both partners. Couples can still adopt the same programs together for adherence and shared benefits—like spotting each other, just without dropping the baby.

1) Tobias DK et al. 2011. Physical Activity Before and During Early Pregnancy and Risk of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-analysis (Tobias 2011)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20980450/]
- Population: Pooled observational studies of generally healthy women; includes preconception activity exposure (not restricted to obese cohorts).
- Exercise description:
  - Habitual leisure-time aerobic activities typical of moderate to vigorous intensity (e.g., brisk walking, running, cycling, swimming, classes).
- Duration and frequency:
  - Categorized by study-specific cut-points; collectively consistent with guideline-level volumes (e.g., ≥150 minutes/week moderate-intensity or some vigorous).
- Methodology:
  - Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies examining preconception and early-pregnancy activity vs incident GDM.
  - Limitations: Observational data (cannot prove causality), self-reported activity (measurement error), variable adjustment sets across studies, heterogeneity in exposure definitions.
- Main findings:
  - Higher preconception physical activity was associated with a significantly lower risk of GDM in subsequent pregnancy, with relative risk reductions commonly in the ~20–30% range across high vs low activity categories.
  - Early-pregnancy activity also showed benefit, but this review specifically supports a preconception contribution.
- Positive effects:
  - Lower GDM risk; improved cardiometabolic profile likely carried into pregnancy.
- Negative effects/risks:
  - No specific harms from preconception activity identified across included studies.

2) Owe KM et al. 2011. Leisure-Time Physical Activity Before/Early in Pregnancy and Preeclampsia Risk (Owe 2011)[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.111.176578]
- Population: Large cohort of generally healthy nulliparous women in Norway; assessed pre-pregnancy and early-pregnancy leisure-time physical activity.
- Exercise description:
  - Walking, jogging, aerobics/fitness classes, and similar leisure-time activities at moderate or higher intensity.
- Duration and frequency:
  - Frequency/intensity categories (e.g., times per week); higher categories reflect meeting or exceeding guideline-like volumes.
- Methodology:
  - Prospective cohort with registry linkage for outcomes; multivariable adjustment for key confounders.
  - Limitations: Observational design, self-reported exposure, potential residual confounding; generalizability best to healthy populations similar to the cohort.
- Main findings:
  - Higher preconception/early-pregnancy activity was associated with a modestly reduced risk of preeclampsia.
- Positive effects:
  - Lower hypertensive disorder risk; better cardiovascular conditioning entering pregnancy.
- Negative effects/risks:
  - None specific identified in healthy women at moderate intensities.

3) Hajizadeh Maleki H & Tartibian B. 2017. Randomized Trial: 24 Weeks of Exercise and Semen Quality in Sedentary Healthy Men (Hajizadeh Maleki 2017)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28100572/]
- Population: Sedentary but otherwise healthy men randomized to exercise modalities or control.
- Exercise description:
  - Moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), high-intensity interval training (HIIT), or high-intensity continuous training; treadmill/cycle-based aerobic protocols supervised in-lab.
- Duration and frequency:
  - ~24 weeks; 3–4 sessions per week; session durations typically 30–45 minutes (modality-specific).
- Methodology:
  - Randomized controlled trial; outcomes included semen concentration, motility, morphology, oxidative stress markers, sperm DNA integrity.
  - Limitations: Male fertility proxies rather than couple pregnancy outcomes; single-center, modest sample size; detraining effects observed after cessation.
- Main findings:
  - MICT and, to a degree, HIIT improved semen quality and sperm DNA integrity compared with controls; very intense continuous training was less favorable.
- Positive effects:
  - Improved semen parameters and oxidative profile—plausible enhancement of couple fecundability when combined with healthy female factors.
- Negative effects/risks:
  - Overly intense continuous training may blunt benefits; gains diminished after detraining (importance of maintenance).

SYNTHESIS AND PRACTICAL TAKEAWAYS (FOR HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS)
----------------------------------------

- Fertility and time-to-pregnancy:
  - Women: Cohorts in healthy populations suggest vigorous preconception activity may modestly improve fecundability (PRESTO 2018), while moderate activity appears neutral—so add some intensity if you’re already comfortable. Avoid extreme training loads if lean and not accustomed.
  - Men: An RCT shows 24 weeks of regular aerobic training (3–4x/week, 30–45 min, moderate intensity) improves semen quality; observational work supports benefits of vigorous PA and cautions against high-volume cycling and marathon TV binges.

- Pregnancy comfort and wellbeing:
  - Direct preconception-only trials on comfort are scarce, but entering pregnancy fitter is consistently associated with better cardiometabolic health, likely less fatigue, and easier daily function. Translation: future you may thank present you when tying shoelaces over a baby bump.

- Pregnancy complications:
  - GDM: Meta-analytic and cohort evidence in generally healthy women indicates higher preconception PA lowers GDM risk.
  - Hypertensive disorders: A large cohort shows preconception/early-pregnancy PA modestly reduces preeclampsia risk.
  - Labour/delivery: Little direct evidence that preconception PA changes labour metrics on its own; benefits likely mediated via reduced complication risks.

- Couples together:
  - Evidence gaps on formal “couples workouts,” but synchronizing moderate-to-vigorous aerobic routines 3–5 days/week supports adherence and covers both partners’ benefits. Think “date night,” but with sweat and fewer nachos.

----------------------------------------
PRACTICAL PROGRAM IDEAS (EVIDENCE-ALIGNED, HEALTHY ADULTS)
----------------------------------------
- Women planning pregnancy:
  - Build toward ≥150 minutes/week moderate-intensity aerobic activity (brisk walking, cycling, swimming) or include 75–150 minutes/week vigorous sessions if accustomed; add 1–2 days/week light-to-moderate resistance training.
- Men planning pregnancy:
  - 3–4 aerobic sessions/week at moderate intensity for ≥12–24 weeks; consider adding intervals; limit very high-volume cycling or optimize bike fit, cooling, and breaks; reduce prolonged sedentary time.
- Couples:
  - Shared brisk walks, runs, swims, or circuit classes; schedule activity in your calendars to increase adherence. Bonus points if you carry the groceries like a strongman to impress your future co-pilot.
