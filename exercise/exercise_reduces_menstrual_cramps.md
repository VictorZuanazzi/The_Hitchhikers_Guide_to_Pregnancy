# Exercises That Reduce Menstrual Cramps

> The Gist: Regular aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, cycling, swimming) and yoga meaningfully reduce menstrual pain. Effects are seen in randomized trials and systematic reviews. Aim for at least 3 sessions/week, 30–45 minutes, sustained for 8–12 weeks.

In doctor speak, menstruation cramps are translated to the lovely name of Primary Dysmenorrhea. The infographic below summarizes the beneficial effects of exercises in reducing pain.

## What the best evidence says

- Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials consistently find that exercise reduces the pain intensity of menstruation cramps:
  - Network meta-analyses and RCT syntheses report significant pain reduction vs. no-exercise controls, with aerobic exercise and yoga among the most effective modalities (Sports Medicine – Open 2024; Pain VAS reduction significant across modalities) [Zhu 2024](https://sportsmedicine-open.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40798-024-00718-4) [Open access summary (Liu 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11569607/).

  - Systematic review/meta-analysis focused on aerobic training shows clinically meaningful pain reductions and suggests a dose–response (AOGS 2022) [Zhang 2022](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aogs.15042).

- Specific RCT trends highlighted within these reviews:
  - Aerobic programs 3–5 days/week, 30–45 min/session, for 8–12 weeks reduce pain and analgesic use.
  - Yoga protocols (e.g., 2–3 sessions/week, 45–60 min, focusing on gentle sequences, breathing/relaxation) reduce pain intensity and improve quality of life.

## Practical recommendations (based on RCTs and reviews)

- Frequency and duration:
  - 3–5 days/week
  - 30–45 minutes per session
  - Maintain for at least 8–12 weeks to assess effect; benefits often sustain with continued practice.

- Modalities with best support:
  - Aerobic: brisk walking, light jogging, cycling, swimming.
  - Yoga: gentle to moderate sequences with breathing and relaxation; avoid extreme poses if painful.
  - Light-to-moderate stretching/mobility can be added, but aerobic/yoga have stronger evidence as primary interventions.

- Intensity:
  - Moderate intensity (you can talk but not sing).
  - Progress gradually if sedentary.

- During painful days:
  - Lower intensity, shorter sessions, or switch to gentle yoga/breathing; many RCTs still report benefit.

## Caveats

- Most trials focus on primary dysmenorrhea in adolescents/young adults; results may differ with secondary causes (e.g., endometriosis)—seek medical evaluation for severe or changing symptoms.
- Protocols vary; adherence and consistent practice matter.
