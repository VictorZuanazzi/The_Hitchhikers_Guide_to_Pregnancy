:warning: in review :warning:

Regular physical activity during pregnancy is safe for most women and confers multiple benefits when performed with appropriate precautions. The guidance and statements below are aligned with high-quality guidelines and meta-analyses.

## Benefits for the mother

Some level of exercise is recommended for most women during pregnancy. However, contraindications may apply to individual cases. Follow clinician guidance for absolute/relative contraindications (e.g., significant heart/lung disease, cervical insufficiency, placenta previa after 26 weeks, preeclampsia, severe anemia [1] ) and be attentive to pain and feeling overheated.

- General safety and efficacy
  - Use the talk test to monitor intensity (you should be able to speak in full sentences during activity) rather than target heart-rate zones, which are less reliable in pregnancy [1,2].

- Weight gain
  - Exercise (often alongside dietary guidance) reduces the risk of excessive gestational weight gain [2,4].

- Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
  - Regular prenatal exercise reduces GDM risk and improves glucose regulation; effects are generally moderate in magnitude [3,5].

- Hypertensive disorders
  - Exercise is associated with a reduced risk of gestational hypertension and may lower preeclampsia risk [3,6].

- Mental health
  - Prenatal physical activity is associated with reduced anxiety and depressive symptoms; effects are small-to-moderate and clinically meaningful for many women [7*].

- Musculoskeletal comfort and function
  - Guidelines support low-impact aerobic and strengthening activities to help manage common discomforts (low back/pelvic girdle pain) and maintain functional capacity [1,2].

- Sleep and energy
  - Many women report better sleep and energy with regular activity; this is consistent with guideline recommendations even though effect sizes vary across studies [2].

## Benefits for the baby

- Fetal growth and birth weight
  - Exercise does not increase risk of small-for-gestational-age and is associated with a lower risk of macrosomia, supporting healthy birth weight distribution [5,8].

- Safety outcomes
  - High-quality evidence shows no increase in miscarriage, preterm birth, or other major adverse outcomes from appropriately prescribed prenatal exercise [1,2,3].

## Labour, delivery, and postpartum

- Labour and mode of delivery
  - Exercise does not worsen labour outcomes and may confer small benefits (e.g., lower odds of certain interventions) depending on program and population; effects are heterogeneous across studies [3].
  - Evidence for a consistent reduction in cesarean delivery is mixed; any benefit, if present, appears modest [3].

- Pelvic floor
  - Pelvic floor muscle training (Kegels) during pregnancy and postpartum reduces urinary incontinence risk and improves symptoms [9].

- Recovery
  - Better prenatal fitness supports functional recovery postpartum; women should resume activity gradually after medical clearance, progressing toward guideline targets [1,2].

## What to do: safe exercise options and parameters

- Recommended volume
  - Aim for at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, accumulated over 3+ days per week (daily is ideal) [1,2].

- Types of exercise commonly recommended
  - Walking, swimming/water aerobics, stationary cycling, low-impact aerobic classes [1,2].
  - Light-to-moderate resistance training focusing on major muscle groups and functional movements [1,2].
  - Prenatal yoga/stretching for flexibility and relaxation (avoid poses that are supine beyond mid-pregnancy or that compress the abdomen) [1,2].
  - Daily pelvic floor muscle exercises (Kegels), as instructed, are encouraged [1,2,9].

- Technique and posture
  - After 16–20 weeks, avoid prolonged supine exercise; modify with side-lying or inclined positions as needed [1,2].

- Environmental and general precautions
  - Avoid activities with high fall risk or abdominal trauma, maintain hydration, avoid overheating, and stop activity with concerning symptoms (e.g., chest pain, contractions, vaginal bleeding, dizziness) [1,2].

- Contraindications
  - Follow clinician guidance for absolute/relative contraindications (e.g., significant heart/lung disease, cervical insufficiency, placenta previa after 26 weeks, preeclampsia, severe anemia) [1].

## Summary table of common exercises and evidence-based guidance

| Exercise | When in pregnancy | Key benefits (from scientific articles) | Cautions | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Walking (moderate pace) | Throughout, with modifications as needed | Supports weight-gain control [4], lowers GDM risk [5], supports BP control [6], mood benefits [7*] | Use talk test; avoid overheating; choose stable surfaces | [1–2,4–7] |
| Swimming / Water aerobics | Throughout; often very comfortable in 2nd–3rd trimesters | Low joint load; supports weight-gain control [4] and cardiometabolic health [5,6]; comfort for back/pelvic symptoms [1] | Avoid overly hot pools; follow hygiene rules | [1–2,4–6] |
| Stationary cycling | Throughout; helpful when balance is a concern | Aerobic fitness; supports glycemic control and reduces GDM risk [5]; low fall risk | Adjust bike fit to accommodate bump; avoid overheating | [1–2,5] |
| Light–moderate resistance training | Throughout, 2–3 days/week | Maintains strength/function; helps manage discomfort; complements weight-gain control [2,4]; potential BP benefits [6] | Prioritize form; avoid Valsalva; use moderate loads | [1–2,4,6] |
| Prenatal yoga / stretching | Throughout, with pose modifications | Flexibility, relaxation, anxiety/depression symptom reduction (as part of overall activity) [7*]; general wellbeing [1] | Avoid supine/inverted/abdominally compressive poses after mid-pregnancy | [1–2,7] |
| Mixed aerobic + resistance (circuits) | Throughout, individualized | Addresses multiple outcomes: GWG, GDM, BP, mood (effects modest–moderate) [3–7] | Progress gradually; monitor intensity with talk test | [1–2,3–7] |
| Pelvic floor muscle training (Kegels) | Throughout pregnancy and postpartum | Prevents/reduces urinary incontinence [9]; supports pelvic health | Learn correct technique; avoid breath-holding | [1–2,9] |

## Practical program tips

- Start where you are: if previously inactive, begin with shorter, more frequent bouts and build up toward 150 minutes/week [1,2].
- Include variety: combine aerobic, resistance, mobility, and pelvic floor work for comprehensive benefits [1–3].
- Monitor intensity with the talk test; adjust on days of higher fatigue or symptoms [1,2].
- Reassess each trimester; modify stance, range of motion, and positions to maintain comfort and safety [1,2].
- Postpartum: resume gradually after medical clearance, progressing toward guideline targets as recovery allows [1].
