## Get that ass moving

Welcome to the sweat-and-smiles corner. Here’s your cheeky, science-backed tour of our exercise articles. Fewer cramps, better moods, stronger bodies, and maybe even faster swimmers — all with fewer groans than leg day.

- Preconception Physical Activity and Fertility — for both of you

  - TL;DR: Moderate exercise for her is neutral-to-beneficial for time-to-pregnancy; go easy on extreme volumes. For him, regular cardio + some strength is linked to better semen quality — maybe swap one TV episode for a brisk walk. Keep the boys cool; bikes are great, boiling them is not.

- Exercises That Reduce Menstrual Cramps — less “ow,” more “ahh”
  - Link: [exercise/exercise_reduces_menstrual_cramps.md](exercise/exercise_reduces_menstrual_cramps.md)
  - TL;DR: Aerobic exercise and yoga 3–5 days/week, 30–45 minutes, for 8–12 weeks meaningfully reduce dysmenorrhea pain in RCTs. On painful days, turn the dial down — gentle movement still helps. Yes, science says yoga pants can be medicinal.

- Physical Exercise During Pregnancy — what’s safe and helpful
  - Link: [exercise/comprehensive_pregnancy_exercise_guide.md](exercise/comprehensive_pregnancy_exercise_guide.md)
  - TL;DR: Most moms-to-be can aim for ~150 min/week of moderate activity. Think walking, swimming, stationary cycling, light–moderate strength, prenatal yoga, plus daily pelvic floor work. Benefits include better weight gain control, lower GDM risk, mood support, and no increase in scary outcomes when done sensibly. Use the talk test, not hero mode.

- Preconception Exercise and Obesity — special notes for obese women (and PCOS)
  - Link: [exercise/exercise_effects_on_obese_women.md](exercise/exercise_effects_on_obese_women.md)
  - TL;DR: In obese infertile women, lifestyle programs (diet + moderate activity) didn’t beat immediate treatment for overall live birth, but did lead to more natural conceptions and better metabolic health. In PCOS, lifestyle-first improved ovulation and may boost live birth when followed by induction. Translation: small, steady habits now can make the path smoother later.

Proud parent energy starts with moving the meat suit you already own. If motivation lags, remember: future you is watching — and judging — from the stroller.
