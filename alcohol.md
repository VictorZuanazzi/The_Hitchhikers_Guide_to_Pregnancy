## The Risks and Fears of Alcohol Consumption 

> **The Gist:** Alcohol is bad for you, always! Even low amounts of alcohol increase ~~risks of cancer~~ long-term health risks. As general advice, drinking less and slower is the mitigation strategy. For pregnant woman, there is robust evidence supporting that one drink a week after the second trimester does not harm the child. Alcohol negatively impacts male fertility, drinking while wanting to conceive is not a good combination. 

First off, any level of alchohol consuption is problematic for everyone, at all ages, pregnant or not. It is not surprising that it has negative consequences for the fetus during the pregnancy. 

In her book _Expecting Better_ Emily Oster presents evidence that a drink a week isn't problematic. She goes as far as claiming that there is no strong evidence against a drink a day. With the caviat that rate of ingestion matters, a can of beer (250ml) should be less problematic than a shot (50ml) of tequila. That raised my eyebrows. 

I checked for sources refuting Emily, and I was intrigued with the general low quality of responses. The response from [NOFAS](https://depts.washington.edu/fasdpn/pdfs/astley-oster2013.pdf) stands out. It starts by quoting the bible and adopts a passive-aggressive tone _"Apparently
we, the medical profession, have taken all the fun out of pregnancy"_ that I would not expect from an scientific - evidence based - organization. 

In any case, this whole debate goes over the drinking habits of the mother, but what about the dad's drinking habits? Can I fuck up my baby before it is even conceived? Drunk drivers drive faster than sober drivers, do drunk sperm swim faster (or sexier!)? I did some digging:

1. [Alcohol impacts on pregancy](alcohol/alcohol_impacts_on_pregnancy.md): I started with reviewing the advice of drinking for pregnant woman and the impacts on the child. 
2. [Alcohol impacts on health](alcohol/alcohol_impacts_on_health.md): To scape the selective bias trap, I looked at the advice for drinking in general. 
3. [Alcohol impacts on male fertility](alcohol/alcohol_impacts_on_male_fertility.md): Concearned about my fertility, I would like to know if my drinking habits are impacting my fatherhood chances.

**what is a standard drink?** 1 standard drink is about 300ml of beer or 120ml of wine acording to the [cancer code europe](https://cancer-code-europe.iarc.fr/index.php/en/ecac-12-ways/alcohol-recommendation/27-standard-drink). But different countries have their own definitions:

- **Australia**: 10g of pure alcohol
- **Brazil**: 10g of pure alcohol
- **Canada**: 13.6g of pure alcohol
- **European Union**: Generally 10g of pure alcohol
- **United Kingdom**: 8g of pure alcohol
- **United States**: 14g of pure alcohol
